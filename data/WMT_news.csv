WMT,2025-06-10 13:18:25,Popular Home Improvement Chain Set To Open New Stores In 2025: Report,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/popular-home-improvement-chain-set-to-open-new-stores-20250610.jpg,https://www.patch.com,"MOORESVILLE, NC — Popular hardware and home improvement store chain Lowe's has opened a number of new stores in 2025 and plans to open more before the end of the year, according to a new report. Additionally, the chain also plans to open more stores in 2026, making it even easier for shoppers across the U.S. to purchase tools, appliances, building materials and more all under one roof. New Store Locations USA Today reports Lowe's plans to open five to 10 new stores this year, two of which have already opened in Magnolia and Fort Worth, Texas. Additionally, a store in Asheville, N.C., that was closed due to Hurricane Helene in September has since reopened. A Lowe's spokesperson also confirmed to USA Today the company plans to open new stores in Georgetown, Texas, and Maricopa, Ariz., later this year. According to a store directory on the company's website, Lowe's operates over 100 stores in Texas and more than 30 in Arizona. Lowe's also operates over 100 stores in North Carolina where the company is headquartered. More Stores To Come In December, Lowe's held its 2024 analyst and investor conference to provide updates on its key growth and productivity initiatives and near-term and long-term financial targets. During the event, the company announced plans to expand its footprint and attract new customers to the brand by opening 10 to 15 stores per year over the next several years in fast-growing markets in the U.S., according to a news release posted to the company's website. ""In planning this next phase of store expansion, the company will build on the success of its recent new store openings, while also leveraging its enhanced space productivity initiatives,"" the release reads. ""With these new stores, the company expects to strengthen its brand position, build its customer base and drive incremental sales and return on invested capital."" According to USA Today, the company's plans for five to 10 new stores in 2025 accounts for time needed to ramp up their opening efforts, and the projected 10 to 15 new stores per year will start in 2026. Store Openings In 2025 Lowe's is just one of several companies to recently announce expansion plans for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026. Furniture retailer IKEA confirmed in May the company has already opened four ""plan and order"" points with pick-up locations, as well as one pick-up point location, thus far in 2025. A company spokesperson said IKEA plans to open three more stores and three more plan and order point with pick up locations before the end of the year, and two more are already in the works for 2026. Walmart also confirmed last month about 10 new stores are scheduled to open by the end of 2025, five of which are set to open by September. Meanwhile, popular hot dog chain Wienerschnitzel confirmed plans to add restaurants to multiple Walmart stores, starting with six owned and operated by local high-caliber franchisees. Grocery store chain Wegmans Food Markets confirmed Friday plans to open a total of three stores this year, with one already open and two more scheduled to open this summer. Culver's, a beloved fast food chain specializing in burgers, chicken and frozen treats, has already opened new restaurants in 15 states thus far in 2025 and has broken ground on new restaurants planned for communities in 12 states. Restaurant chain Raising Cane's, which specializes in chicken finger meals and combos, recently announced plans for new locations in Massachusetts and Connecticut as the company continues to expand throughout the Northeast.",https://www.patch.com/us/across-america/popular-home-improvement-chain-set-open-new-stores-2025-report

WMT,2025-06-10 11:04:10,Why I Think Walmart and Aldi Grocery Prices Are the Same – Are We Alone in This Opinion?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/why-i-think-walmart-and-aldi-grocery-prices-are-20250610.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"As people all over the country are looking for any way possible to reduce their overall expenses, cheaper groceries are at the top of everyone’s list. Enter Aldi and Walmart, two of the more affordable grocery options available to most people. Key Points This Redditor is trying to gauge whether others agree with his assessment of which grocery store is cheaper. Comparing Walmart and Aldi pricing isn’t new, as both of these grocers aim to save people money. When you need more than just groceries, Walmart is the easy choice, offering a wide range of options, including electronics and a pharmacy. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) For one Redditor, they are trying to decide exactly which one of these two stores is less expensive. Posting in r/MiddleClassFinance, their admittedly unpopular opinion is that these two stores are far closer in pricing than most people believe. Grocery Shopping Duel It should go without saying that for most people, Aldi and Walmart are considered two of the least expensive grocery options. In this Redditor’s eyes, when they did some research on everyday items like milk, eggs, or meat, there was almost no difference in price. In fact, after becoming an Aldi believer for a while, the original poster switched back to Walmart after realizing they were not saving all that much. As a family of five living in Michigan, this Redditor is likely looking at slightly higher grocery bills with a few extra mouths to feed. However, they are also away from coastal cities where prices tend to be a little higher. So, is it true that Aldi and Walmart are close in price, or is this Redditor’s belief solely reserved for their scenario? Which Store Is Actually Cheaper? Even a quick Google search will tell you that Walmart and Aldi are likely to trade positions as the least expensive grocers. In the case of meat, there is a good chance that Aldi will win; however, as of the beginning of June 2025, online pricing is relatively even for eggs. The same goes for milk, where both stores are under $3 for 2% milk, so it’s a tie here as well. If you are someone who loves Almond Milk, Aldi takes the win. However, as you continue to explore other options, such as bananas, pasta sauces, and even dish soap, Aldi is generally a little less expensive. However, there is a significant caveat to saying that while Aldi might be cheaper, in some cases, “cheaper” only means a few pennies. In other words, this Redditor’s belief that these two stores are relatively close in price is not far off from reality. Moving on to the comments on this post, there is a fairly healthy debate about which one is cheaper, with no clear winner. Aldi does seem to receive more praise from people who regularly shop at both, but even they admit that the price difference is relatively small. What About Quality? While Aldi and Walmart may be close in price, it immediately raises the question of which store offers better quality. In this case, there is a pretty convincing argument that Aldi wins this category. It’s hard to pinpoint when Walmart’s reputation for quality began to take a hit, but it has certainly developed a reputation for being of lesser quality than its competitors. In the case of the original poster, they admit that while their Walmart has pretty good fruit, they have been to others where they wouldn’t touch the fruit at all. Other Redditors in the comments echo the same sentiment, expressing concerns that the quality of Aldi&#8217;s produce, pantry goods, meat, and other fresh goods is far superior. Aldi has a standout reputation right now for offering great quality at low prices, giving it an easy win in this category. The caveat is that if there isn’t an Aldi near you, shopping at Walmart will not only not break the bank, but you can certainly find quality items if you spend some time digging through fruits and vegetables. Of course, if you need something other than food, such as electronics or clothing, or want to buy a large quantity of plastic spoons and plates for a birthday party, there is a good chance most people will go to Walmart first.

The Dividends subreddit was bustling after one investor asked if people regretted buying dividend stocks too early or too late in their journey. For instance, some people may regret buying dividend stocks in their 20s because they saw growth stocks outperform them for more than a decade. On the other hand, other investors may wish they got into dividend stocks in their 40s instead of waiting for their 60s due to market volatility and steep losses from unprofitable investments. Dividend investors shared their thoughts and some advice for people who are considering dividend stocks. Key Points Should you buy dividend stocks in your 20s? Redditors shared their thoughts. Dividend growth stocks make more sense for younger investors, but high-yield stocks become a priority as people get older and approach retirement. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Buy Stocks For The Long Run One of the top comments came from a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) investor who bought shares at $6 apiece and held on to them. The investor now has 1,110 shares and receives an annual dividend that is close to 16% of the initial investment. That&#8217;s the advantage of buying dividend growth stocks. These corporations pay dividends but still have plenty of growth prospects left. Even at its current level of success, Walmart still has growth opportunities. Online advertising, e-commerce, and retail locations are some of the company&#8217;s growth levers. Buying dividend stocks doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be stuck with mature, high-yield companies. For instance, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a dividend yield above 1% and has crushed the stock market with a 685% gain over the past five years. Why Wait To Invest? Multiple dividend investors asked why people would wait to invest. Some people said they wished they could invest when they were born, while others wished they invested in their early 20s. People weren&#8217;t expressing regret about entering stocks in their 20s and 30s. Waiting to invest doesn&#8217;t make much sense if you want to become wealthy. The longer you let your money sit in the stock market, the more time you have to compound your returns. Waiting to invest causes your money to lose value due to inflation. A high-yield savings account is better than nothing, but it can&#8217;t appreciate like dividend stocks. You only get the cash flow from a bank account, while dividend stocks can double in value over the course of 5-10 years. Transition To High-Yield Dividend Stocks When You Need Steady Income A few dividend investors said that it makes sense to diversify into high-yield stocks when they need additional income. Many investors focused on dividend growth stocks or index funds that tracked major indices like the S&amp;P 500 when they were younger. Then, they gradually sold off some of those holdings and shifted into funds with lower risk and higher yields. Every person has a different financial situation and long-term goals. If you don&#8217;t need to sell your assets within the next decade and don&#8217;t need dividend income, it may make more sense to focus on growth-oriented opportunities. However, your plans may look different if you want to sell your stocks in 1-3 years to buy a house. Then, it may be better to take a cautious approach and focus on funds that have high yields and steady growth instead of riskier funds that aim to produce 10%+ annualized returns. If you&#8217;re just getting started, you can diversify your portfolio with dividend stocks and growth-oriented stocks. Reinvesting dividends ensures that your dividend income grows over time and can eventually cover your living expenses. Monitoring dividend stocks can help you build a robust portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

You likely have a pretty good idea of how much the family spends on food monthly. If you told your family members exactly what this number is, they&#8217;d likely be shocked. Key Points The cost of groceries is only going up, but it shouldn’t be a family’s biggest expense. In the case of this Redditor, the family is spending a good portion of their monthly income on food and dining out. There are several ways to reduce the cost of groceries, such as meal prepping each week. Are you spending too much money on groceries? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How much a family spends on groceries is exactly what one Redditor posting in r/MiddleClassFinance is worried about. In this family&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s far too easy to get carried away with overspending each month, especially when it comes to dining out. Large Grocery Bill What&#8217;s surprising is that this Redditor outright admits the family spends around $1,400 per month on groceries. For a family of three, including a two-year-old, this is entirely too much money. Having tracked their spending since June 2024, there is a real-world concern. When the Redditor breaks down this total number, we learn that the family’s average monthly grocery bill is $692. Additionally, they are spending $405 on fast food and takeout, as well as $289 on dining out. For a family earning around $9,000 per month, this number should be alarming. In fact, the grocery budget is likely their second biggest expense, after a mortgage, which is a reasonable concern. If the question is whether or not they are spending too much, the answer is a resounding yes. Average Monthly Spend According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly cost of groceries is $504 as of late 2024. The total annual cost for families should be approximately $6,043. Compared to other families, this family spends over $16,000 on food and groceries each month, far exceeding the average amount typically spent by families. Another consideration is that the US Department of Agriculture states that, for a family of four, the monthly budget in March 2025 should be $996. Even if you subtract a little for a family of three, their total expense is still well outpacing what the agreed-upon spending should be for a family. How to Spend Smarter First and foremost, this family and Redditor need to set up a detailed monthly budget to look at where they can cut back. Spending half of their grocery bill on food that is made at home is crazy. In other words, eating out and or bringing food in has to stop immediately. Setting a Budget There should be a budget set for how many times a month the family will order in or take out, and that’s all they can do for the whole month. Grocery spending is a necessity, but dining out or ordering fast food is a luxury. As a result, it shouldn’t be too challenging to make this change. Finding Coupons In addition, this family needs to become more savvy about coupons, discount grocery stores, and taking advantage of farmers’ markets, among other strategies. Using websites like iBotta or Coupons.com to save money can be a real advantage. Yes, it takes a little extra time to go through and save digital coupons, but the payoff is quickly evident in the savings. Meal Prepping Another potential option is meal prep for the family, which provides a set menu for the week. Let’s assume the family goes to the grocery shops on the weekend. This allows them to meal prep for the week, including lunches and dinners, which is likely where most of the excess spending goes. House Brands Another consideration is to buy generic brands at the grocery store, such as those from Great Value at Walmart or Favorite Day at Target. The savings here can really add up, and the food rarely tastes any different, so there is plenty of money to be saved. As someone who regularly buys Target’s house brands, I can personally attest to there being very little difference in taste, except that everything costs less.

The popular hot dog brand confirmed Friday plans to add restaurants to multiple Walmart stores, starting with six owned and operated by local high-caliber franchisees. According to Wienerschnitzel, the Walmart restaurants will enable the company to ""[expand] into target markets through non-traditional avenues."" Where Will They Be Located? The six restaurants are set to open by this fall in Walmart stores in the following communities: The Walmart locations will all feature the chain's full menu, including iconic items like the chili cheese dog, junkyard dog, chili cheese fries, jalapeño poppers and ""tastee freez"" soft serve desserts. As the brand looks to scale its presence, these partnerships provide a blueprint for future growth while maintaining its iconic brand appeal, according to Wienerschnitzel. A Walmart spokesperson noted the store chain is ""always looking for prospective tenants, excited to possibly bring their business to our stores."" Growing Brands According to Wienerschnitzel, the move into Walmart stores sparks a new focus on non-traditional growth for the company. Supporting this expansion and fueling the brand's momentum are strategic new hires like Shak Turner, the brand's newest director of franchise expansion. Turner, who joined the company in March, will mainly focus on driving growth across non-traditional formats and attracting high-ranking multi-unit franchise candidates, according to Wienerschnitzel. ""Wienerschnitzel has spent decades building a strong reputation, especially on the West Coast, and this expansion into Walmart stores signifies a new era of growth for the brand,"" Turner said in a news release. ""It's clear Wienerschnitzel's unique concept fills a specific void for multi-brand franchisees looking to grow their portfolios, which is one of the elements that attracted me to the brand initially. I'm thrilled to join this amazing team and play a part in spearheading initiatives and new partnerships, which will no doubt catapult the brand to new markets."" There are currently 340 franchised Wienerschnitzel locations in operation throughout 13 states, and more than 50 units in various stages of development across the U.S., according to the company. Founded by John Galardi in 1961 with a single hot dog stand in Wilmington, Calif., the company now bills itself as ""the world's largest hot dog chain."" Based in Tustin, Calif., Galardi Group Inc. franchises 340 Wienerschnitzel restaurants in 13 states. The group is also the parent company and franchisor of Hamburger Stand and Tastee Freez, LLC. This week, Walmart confirmed plans to open five new stores and a new Sam's Club location by the end of September, with a total of 10 new stores planned to be open by the end of 2025.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) lost 2.29% over the past five trading sessions, halting a rally that has seen the stock gain 23.16% since its year-to-date low of $167.32 on April 21. On the year, the e-commerce giant has seen its stock lose 6.42% despite beating on EPS and revenue by 16.77% and 0.35%, respectively, in Q1. Tempered forward guidance due to President Trump&#8217;s tariffs continues to cloud Amazon&#8217;s outlook. However, with the U.S. and China agreeing to a 90-day reduction in tariffs on May 11, there is renewed hope for the consumer discretionary mainstay, who has seen its one-year gain diminished to 12.28%. In its recent earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% in 2025, with its one-year gain having been erased in Q1, which now stands at a 0.79% loss. In early April, Piper Sandler lowered its price target for Amazon to $215 from $265; however, the firm maintained its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating saying it is looking for Q1 revenue of $153B and within the $151B–$155B guidance range. Piper forecasts AWS growth of 17% year-over-year. For Q2, the firm anticipates a guidance range of $157B–$162B and op income guidance of $14B–$18B. Piper lowered its 2025 ads revenue growth by about 1% and online stores and 3P services. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. Key Points in This Article: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has sunk 15.15%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; $240.62 consensus price target is just shy of Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 48 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 64.01% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,927 position increases versus 2,426 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -5.02% Median $240.62 17.19% High $305.00 48.55% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumers appear to be pulling back on spending due to ongoing inflation, contracting GDP in Q1 and the possibility of a recession in 2025. Over the past month, however, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed admirably, posting a gain of 18.14%, second only to tech&#8217;s gain of 21.31% over the same period. That rebound represents a stark difference from the sector&#8217;s last-place performance among the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 11 sectors through Q1 2025. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

These are rock-solid businesses with the ability to increase their dividends in the future. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) I started my investment journey at a young age and my secret to investing is to buy blue-chip dividend stocks. All I wanted was steady passive income and I built a portfolio of some of the Dividend Aristocrats that never let me down. No matter where you are in your investment journey, if your goal is to make money through investments, pick dividend companies. Choose companies that have a history of rewarding shareholders and you will always have income flowing into your bank account. I’ve invested in these three dividend stocks for a decade and I’ve managed to build a resilient portfolio through dividend reinvestment. Coca-Cola A blue-chip dividend stock, Coca-Cola is a globally recognized brand. Over 100 years old, the company has expanded its offerings keeping the changing consumer preferences in mind. It owns some of the most famous brands including Coke, Minute Maid, Sprite, and Fanta. The company has a long-term growth strategy driven by successful marketing, innovation, and brand strength. In the first quarter, it reported a 6% rise in organic revenue and a 5% jump in price/mix. Coca-Cola has the pricing power to remain resilient even in times of geopolitical uncertainty. Exchanging hands for $71, KO stock is up 14% year-to-date and 11% in six months. The stock’s current dividend yield is 2.87% and it has increased dividends for 63 consecutive years which speaks a lot about the management. It has an annual dividend growth rate of 5.36% and a five-year growth rate of 4.07%. Coca-Cola’s 10-year dividend growth rate is 4.67%. When I bought the stock a decade ago, its annual dividend yield was 4.12% which remained steady until 2019. Since 2019, it has remained below 4% while the annual payout has steadily increased. The annual payout amount is currently the highest in the decade at $1.94 and the annual year-over-year payout growth is 5.43% Coca-Cola has a history of delivering steady gains despite market ups and downs. The company has remained resilient in times of a pandemic, and geopolitical tensions which makes it my top choice. Walmart Inc. When I invested in Walmart in 2015, it was the most convenient way to shop. With over 4,600 locations in the U.S., I could always find a Walmart near me. Founded 8 decades ago, the company is one of the largest retailers in terms of revenue. A blue-chip stock, Walmart has never disappointed. Despite the growing popularity of e-commerce, Walmart has retained its top spot. The company has paid a regular quarterly dividend for 51 years and it has a payout ratio of 51.04% which shows that the company is reinvesting the remaining of its earnings in the business. This also means there is a potential for a higher dividend in the coming years. Walmart’s dividend yield is 0.98% and its five-year dividend growth rate is 4.41%. Its 4-year average dividend yield is 1.39%. WMT stock’s 10-year dividend growth rate is 3.26% which is lower than the sector median of 5.93% but I like the stability Walmart brings to my investment portfolio. The Dividend King boosted the dividend by 13% recently. Exchanging hands for $95, the stock is up 6.5% year to date and 47% in the year. In the first quarter, it saw a 4.5% year-over-year jump in same-store sales, and advertising sales were up 50%. Walmart is investing in e-commerce and advertising which has helped with revenue growth. Truist Securities analyst has a price target of $111 per share and a buy rating. The business is stronger than ever and I’d hold on to the stock for at least another five years. Chevron Corporation I’ve always believed that the oil and gas sector is one of the most prominent sectors of the economy. There will never be a time when the world will not need oil and this means Chevron Corporation will never run out of business. Yes, the energy industry is volatile and the changing crude oil prices impact the stock but Chevron has managed to remain steady amid the volatility. A dividend stock, the company has increased dividends for 38 consecutive years. It has an attractive dividend yield of 4.8%, higher than the industry average of 3.6%. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 70.97% showing the management’s commitment towards rewarding shareholders. The quarterly dividends have gone from $1.07 in 2015 to $1.71 in 2025. Its 10-year dividend growth rate is 4.55% while the 3-year dividend growth rate is 6.56%. Chevron stock has never disappointed. It is up 49% in 5 years but the current market volatility and the drop in crude oil prices have impacted the stock which has lost 7.78% value year-to-date. Trading for $135, the stock is very close to the 52-week low of $132 and I consider this a solid chance to buy. Crude oil prices will rise and there will always be oil demand. Chevron has several assets that will keep generating revenue, one of the most prominent ones in the Permian basin. It is a rock-solid business with an attractive balance sheet and a steady dividend payout.

It is a necessary qualifying component of the KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols for financial professionals, and is implemented to establish levels of investment risk that a new customer is comfortable taking. While the ideal investment delivers big capital appreciation and AAA principal safety, the maxim “no guts no glory” applies also to investing, where the largest returns are generally the ones that are the riskiest ventures. Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are a popular vehicle for diversified investments, as they can be bought and sold online with ease and are usually subject to lower fees than mutual funds. ETFs come in a wide range of configurations, and are generally passively managed and designed to mimic the performance of designated market indexes. Key Points Dividend growth, in the majority of cases, is a stock indicator of a company’s business success, since dividend growth usually is commensurate with profit growth. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF is a popular ETF platform for investors to avail themselves of blue chip companies with a steady track record for both dividend increases and price appreciation growth. Deployment of a dividend reinvestment protocol can substantially boost overall ROI for investments in an ETF such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF.

Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) For those investors who have found the S&amp;P 500 Index too volatile for their liking, there is another index that offers steady growth, albeit at a slower pace, combined with a strong income component and lower volatility. The S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index is one such benchmark. Containing Dividend Kings (50 or more consecutive years of increased dividends) and Dividend Aristocrats (25 or more years in a row of increased dividends), this index contains Fortune 500 companies whose businesses are historically profitable enough that they can afford to continue higher dividend payouts year after year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VIG) is a popular ETF with a portfolio reflecting this exact index. Founded in 2006, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF strives for a mix of capital appreciation and income from dividend growth companies, i.e. those with a history of dividend increases accompanying growth. Its yield is 1.87% and it has a 0.05% expense ratio. The dividend increases have to be consistent for a minimum of 10 years to warrant inclusion. Surprisingly, the top 25% companies with the highest yields are excluded from the 330+ stocks on the VIG roster. VIG has a Morningstar gold ETF ranking. It had $101.79 billion assets under management (AUM) as of the time of this writing. A look at VIG’s top 10 holdings shows how its criteria differ from S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs, which are usually led by Magnificent 7 stocks, based on market cap size: Broadcom Microsoft Apple Eli Lilly JP Morgan Chase Visa, Inc. Exxon Mobil MasterCard Costco Wholesale Walmart The VIG Dividend Difference As the calculator demonstrates, a $15,000 investment in VIG back in January, 2020 would be worth $25,833.91 today, at the time of this writing, which equates to a 72.23% ROI. The total return would be $10,833.91. The annualized return equates to 10.62%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value is $2,425.58. The actual cash dividends paid out from the initial 119.67 shares equates to $1,849.45. If the dividends are not reinvested, the total return would be $8,408.33. Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return differential of $2,425.58 over the 5 year span. The Dividend Reinvestment Advantage For Safer Returns Dividend stocks with annual payout growth can boost capital appreciation through compounding, or provide extra income in the case of emergencies. As the charts demonstrate, reinvesting dividends contributed a 22% boost to ROI, while overall capital appreciation growth still averaged over 10% annually. Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIP) can automatically implement purchases of additional shares without additional fees or order entries, if one is so inclined. In the case of an ETF such as VIG, investors with weaker stomachs for volatility can sleep more easily, knowing that their portfolios are still growing albeit without the roller coaster ride delivered by Nvidia, for example. Another plus to VIG is that since it contains both current and potential future Dividend King and Dividend Aristocrat stocks, the dividend amounts will continue to grow with each passing year. This will, in turn, increase the amount of additional shares that can be obtained under a DRIP agreement. This is a classic compounding model for health building that can work for the benefit of many investors. On the contingency side, the investor can always cancel the DRIP agreement if there is an emergency need for the dividend income pending, since it can always be renewed at a later date after the crisis has passed.

(NASDAQ: PYPL) gained 16.64% over the past month, joining in the broad market&#8217;s rally that has been propelled by the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause between the U.S. and China. However, the stock is still struggling longer-term, with a year-to-date loss of 16.85% and a nearly 22% loss since hitting its one-year high on Jan. 17, 2025. Long before there was Venmo and Cash App, there was PayPal. The pioneer of online payments was founded in 1998 in San Jose, Calf. Four years later, it went public and was then acquired by eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) later in 2022. But in 2015, eBay spun the company off to its shareholders, and PayPal has been an independent company ever since. Since then, the company&#8217;s online payments services have exploded in popularity, with its market cap peaking at $356.75 billion in July 2021. That coincided with the stock reaching its all-time high of $308.53. However, the company has endured some growing pains since then, which have resulted in its market cap being reduced to the current $60.96 billion and shares having fallen more than -80% from their all-time high in July 2021. But for prospective investors looking for growth opportunity, PayPal sits in the midst of an industry undergoing explosive growth. According to Grand View Research, the global fintech service market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5% from 2023 to 2030. This expected industry growth bodes very well for shareholders. And despite the stock being down significantly from its all-time high, PayPal has gained 43.68% in 2024, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 over the same period. 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside potential for the fintech company before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect from PayPal over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Globally, the fintech service market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.5% from 2023 to 2030, and in the U.S. alone, that growth is forecast for 16.6% over the same time. PayPal isn&#8217;t simply processing payments between friends or businesses, but participating in a major shift that involves &#8220;fintech solution providers that consistently introduce novel technologies like AI, blockchain and data analytics, with the potential to reshape financial services and streamline operational effectiveness,&#8221; according to Grand View Research. Online payments is a segment seeing exponential growth, and that has translated into a series of successive earnings beats for PayPal, which are likely to continue as the company gains more market share. Payment service providers, or PSPs, are now being tasked with with expanded service demands, like fraud mitigation, improving collection processes and reconsidering markets where profitable growth may be possible but has previously exceeded most institutions’ risk appetite, such as the gaming industry, according to consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Co.

PayPal&#8217;s Recent Stock Success Since officially being spun off from eBay on July 10, 2015, shares of PayPal enjoyed an incredible run before hitting their all-time high in July 2021, gaining over 789%. That surge was largely fueled from the arrival of COVID-19, which saw a dramatic shift to online buying. From its pandemic low on $86.68 on March 20, 2020, the stock rewarded shareholders with gains of 256% over the subsequent six quarters. However, the end of the pandemic coupled with increased competition began to erode the company&#8217;s market share since, which has forced PayPal to begin diversifying its business segments in order to expand customer services and differentiate itself from newcomers like Stripe, Amazon Pay, Apple Pay and Square. Year Share Price Revenue* Net Income* 2015 $36.20 $9.192 $1.551 2016 $39.47 $10.839 $1.816 2017 $73.62 $12.983 $2.281 2018 $83.26 $15.460 $2.883 2019 $109.40 $17.750 $3.654 2020 $234.20 $21.418 $4.519 2021 $188.58 $25.349 $5.466 2022 $71.22 $27.500 $4.722 2023 $61.41 $29.614 $5.521 *Revenue and net income in $billions Since 2015 when PayPal was again a publicly traded company, its total annual revenue grew by more than 222% through 2023. However, the two aforementioned headwinds beginning in 2021 — increased competition and the end of the pandemic — saw its share price careen despite steadily increased revenue and consistent net income. At the same time, PayPal became mired in debt repayment, which jumped from $361 million in 2021 to $1.05 billion in 2023. Nonetheless, as the Silicon Valley fixture looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact PayPal’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of PayPal&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Demand for Digital Payments Is Exploding. Data from Statista indicates that digital payments from PSPs has exploded from $6.25 trillion in 2017 to $15.46 trillion in 2023 — a 147% increase. That figure is forecast to reach $36.75 trillion in 2029, $23.50 trillion of which will be made in mobile payments alone. PayPal&#8217;s seamless integration, which is used in 200 countries and regions and with 25 different currencies, is likely to face increased demand as merchants who rely on it look to capitalize on rapid customer onboarding and user-friendliness, both of which are expected to drive the digital payments market in the near and medium terms. The company is already well-positioned, with its digital financial network accounting for 220 million active customers each month, making it one of the world’s largest PSP in the world. 2. Strong Earnings and Revenue Has Continued. Despite the stock&#8217;s slide since midway 2021, PayPal has time and again posted strong quarterly earnings and revenue. Since the fourth quarter of 2020, the company has beat on earnings 16 out of 19 quarters. It is a similar story for reported quarterly revenue over that period. That has left the company with a healthy cash position, with free cash flow exploding in growth from $3.37 billion in 2019 to a current trailing 12-month (TTM) position of $6.71 billion. That is good for an increase of more than 99% in five years. 3. PayPal Credit and Buy Now, Pay Later Is Expanding the Company&#8217;s Breadth. Beyond being a PSP, PayPal has branched out to other business sectors that are likely to bolster revenue as they experience similar CAGRs: credit and buy now, pay later. These services are already offered at major retailers and online merchants, like Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD), Temu and eBay, for example. The site provides consumers with a line of revolving credit through Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF). In 2023, of PayPal&#8217;s nearly $30 billion in revenue, $27 billion came from transaction revenues, with PSP transactions representing more than 90% of the company&#8217;s total revenue. Meanwhile, revenues from its other business segments — including interest and fees through its credit offerings — were over $2.91 billion, which represented roughly 9% of the company&#8217;s revenue. However, Grand View Research projects the buy now, pay later industry to undergo CAGR of 24.3% from 2023 to 2030, meaning this business segment for PayPal could see its revenue growth outpace the company&#8217;s traditional PSP offerings by the end of this decade. PayPal (PYPL) Stock Prediction in 2025 The current median one-year price target for PayPal is $82.48, representing upside potential of 15.13% over the next 12 months from its current share price. Of the 33 analysts covering PayPal, the stock receives a consensus rating of &#8220;Moderate Buy,&#8221; with 15 analysts assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 16 assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and two assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s forecast for shares of PYPL is $81.15, good for 13.27% upside potential based on an annualized EPS estimate of $4.93 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio estimate of 16.

She has never been seen alive since her disapperance. This week, in an unrelated investigation, Joliet police arrested her 28-year-old son, Joshua ""Josh"" Gessing, who now lives in Wilmington, according to the arrest report. Josh Gessing continues to have run-ins with Joliet police and area law enforcement in recent years. He was jailed by Joliet police for four days in 2023 in connection with driving under the influence charges. According to Joliet police spokesman Dwayne English, the 28-year-old Gessing was captured on Tuesday and put into the Will County Jail for having an outstanding Will County arrest warrant. On Tuesday, at 12:45 p.m., Joliet's officers responded to the Walmart at 2424 W. Jefferson St. regarding a retail theft investigation. Upon arrival, the officers learned that the Walmart staff had initially detained a man as part of a retail theft investigation, but determined no charges would be pursued. Officers identified the man as Gessing and determined he held an active Will County arrest warrant for possession of controlled substances, according to English. Gessing was placed into custody without incident, English noted. Will County Jail indicate the Gessing was released from the jail on Wednesday afternoon. Back in October 2021, Gessing was the subject of a Joliet Patch crime story headlined, ""Criminal Charges Dropped Against Crest Hill's Joshua Gessing."" At that time, he was 25 years old. Patch reported that Josh Gessing spent four days in the Will County jail in connection with allegations he attacked a 44-year-old male relative late on a Friday night at a house on Joliet's west side. Joliet police officers arrested Josh Gessing on charges of aggravated domestic battery causing great bodily harm. During a short phone interview at that time, Josh Gessing told Joliet Patch he was the victim of a wrongful arrest by the Joliet Police Department. ""It was a wrongful arrest,"" he said. ""I was the victim, and he was the aggressor.""",https://www.patch.com/illinois/joliet/missing-crest-hill-woman-wendy-gessings-son-arrested-once-again

(Walmart has 4,600 in the United States, and it ranked 81st.) 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Grocery retailer Trader Joe’s has topped the reputation ranking in the Axios Harris Poll 100 for 2025. It edged out Microsoft, Toyota, Costco, and others. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The study&#8217;s methodology involved three waves of surveys. The first asked consumers to rank the best and worst companies. The second survey determined the 100 companies. The third asked about “contextual” issues, including opinions about brands and topics, including politics. These were in the field from January through mid-May. Following Trader Joe’s on the list were clothing company Patagonia, Microsoft, Toyota, and retail giant Costco. Trader Joe’s rose 12 spots from last year’s list. Trader Joe’s seems to have a cult following. It targets building local communities through grants to nonprofits, along with food and beverage donations, Trader Joe’s is known among its customers for an unusual level of transparency. This has to do with food prices, why some items are discontinued, and why prices differ from location to location. It also rarely sells products that carry another company’s brands Trader Joe’s also has several unique methods used to target customers. Its traditional direct marketing includes newsletters. Content in what it calls The Fearless Flyer is based on anecdotes and stories about products it sells. The theory behind it appears to be that it cements its relationship with shoppers. The company uses podcasts and recipes for similar reasons. Axios Harris Poll 100 produces non-traditional results. Trader Joe’s and Patagonia are niche companies. Microsoft, Toyota, and Costco are among the largest companies that do business in the United States, as well as among America’s most well-known brands. It also lists J.C.

Undoubtedly, individuals are under no obligation to help finance their parents&#8217; retirement. But for those who have more than enough (and are perhaps already retired themselves), it can make sense to give them a bit of a boost or step in as a sort of caregiver. In this piece, we&#8217;ll check in on a specific Reddit case involving a Millennial couple who&#8217;s pulling in a respectable combined income of $160,000. With no kids in the equation, they&#8217;re effectively in the DINK (dual income, no kids) camp, with potentially enough financial flexibility to help the parents make up for lost time since they&#8217;re nearing the retirement finish line and coming up well short of an amount that&#8217;d be enough to fund a comfortable retirement. Though things can get tricky when balancing one&#8217;s own priorities with those of the parents, striving for balance can be a good thing. And in this piece, we&#8217;ll go over the Reddit user&#8217;s plan as well as pitfalls they should avoid as they attempt the ultimate balancing act of middle age. Key Points This Reddit user wants to help their parents retire. And they&#8217;re willing to do so at their own expense. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Taking the role of a retirement planner First up, our Reddit user is putting on their retirement planner hat by getting a better sense of their parents&#8217; broader financial situation. Indeed, crunching all the numbers (assets versus liabilities as well as cash inflows and outflows) and listening to wants, concerns, and expectations are all a must before lending a helping hand. After all, it&#8217;s hard to tell where one can improve their financial circumstances without carefully analyzing the balance sheet and cash flows. And though being 100% financially transparent with a child can seem like a stretch, it&#8217;s a necessary step. Otherwise, one would effectively be flying blind, and that&#8217;s never a good idea if one&#8217;s playing catch-up on retirement. Even if our Reddit user is financially literate, I think it still makes sense to bring on board a financial advisor. They can help in areas where our Reddit user can&#8217;t. Perhaps health insurance plans and investment asset allocation are areas where an advisor could bring value to the table. Trimming away at monthly expenses Our Reddit user has had all the right conversations and has decided to give their parents a bit of a financial boost well before a disaster (think a health expense) can happen. Before plowing a big chunk of one&#8217;s paycheck into the parents&#8217; retirement funds, though, I&#8217;d suggest exploring ways to trim away at monthly expenses. For many folks, housing is the loftiest expense. And it may be the one to trim away at first. If the retirement situation really is getting tight, perhaps moving the parents in (a multi-generational household) is a great way to free up extra cash to be invested in an S&amp;P 500 ETF or something of the sort for the retirement fund. If there are more generations under one household, added savings can be had from sharing a vehicle and buying in bulk at the local grocery store (think Costco). All considered, I think such a move is more of a must if our Reddit user is serious about helping their parents make up for lost time. Not compromising on one&#8217;s own retirement is vital. It&#8217;s a noble thing to help out one&#8217;s parents financially, especially if they&#8217;re due to come up short come retirement, even after Social Security and pensions are considered. That said, our Reddit user shouldn&#8217;t risk their own retirement, especially if they&#8217;re behind various milestones already. In any case, with a relatively high income and no kids to worry about, I do see the balance of saving for one&#8217;s own retirement and those of the parents as achievable, provided the right steps are taken to axe out unnecessary costs. In short, this Reddit user seems to be on the right track, but should ensure they&#8217;re not putting their parents above themselves or their partner.

The cloud-based AI data storage company is largely expected to come through with flying colors. Firms like Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and Evercore ISI are all expecting Snowflake to outperform considering its resilience throughout the tariff era. Jefferies analysts aren&#8217;t wasting any time and have already raised their price target on the stock to $200 per share, reflecting 20.8% upside potential. The markets remain under pressure, including a 0.23% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. S&amp;P 500 Earnings Outlook 11:02 am by Gerelyn Terzo Most of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported Q1 earnings already, and according to Factset data, the results are largely impressive. Of the companies that have reported already, over three-quarters (78%) of S&amp;P 500 companies have revealed a positive EPS surprise, while more than half (62%) of them have surprised to the upside on revenue. Nevertheless, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that Wall Street earnings estimates on S&amp;P 500 companies have further to fall amid persistent tariff uncertainty. Improved Market Sentiment 9:55 am by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America published a report revealing that sentiment around the broader stock market has improved, with its equity risk-love indicator flipping from deep panic last month to a neutral reading most recently. If history is any indication, this improvement suggests stocks could soon revisit their record-high levels, despite today&#8217;s lackluster performance. The Nasdaq Composite is currently down 0.48%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets came out of the gate lower across the board this morning after managing to eke out slight gains yesterday. Yesterday&#8217;s market performance marked the sixth straight day of gains for the S&amp;P 500, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also moved higher. After Moody&#8217;s cut the U.S. debt rating by one notch, Deutsche Bank weighed in saying the U.S. economy is &#8220;suffering death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; The Wall Street firm&#8217;s Jim Reid wrote, &#8220;Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation.

Dow stock Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has no plans to pass along tariff-related costs to customers, unlike fellow Dow component Walmart&#8217;s (NYSE: WMT), which had earlier plans to do so.

WMT,2025-05-21 10:30:57,S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) Live: Markets Hold Back on Fiscal Outlook,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/sp-500-nysearca-spy-live-markets-hold-back-on-20250521.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended SNOW Earnings Expectations 1:45 pm by Gerelyn Terzo As earnings season rolls on, Snowflake (Nasdaq: SNOW) is certainly on the radar of Wall Street analysts, with the cloud-based AI data storage firm set to report results this week. Expectations are largely high, anticipating a strong performance from the company. Analyst firms such as Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, and Evercore ISI are all forecasting an outperformance for Snowflake, citing its demonstrated resilience even amid the recent tariff challenges. Jefferies analysts, in particular, have already taken action, boosting their price target on the stock to $200 per share, indicating a potential 20.8% upside. This sense of bullishness comes as the broader markets remain under pressure, including a 0.24% decline in the SPY ETF. Earnings Roundup 11:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first-quarter earnings season still unfolding, the performance of most S&amp;P 500 companies has proven notably robust. FactSet data illustrates this strength: a significant 78% of reporting S&amp;P 500 firms delivered a positive earnings per share (EPS) surprise, and over half (62%) also exceeded revenue forecasts. Despite these strong results, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sounded a cautionary note, suggesting that Wall Street&#8217;s current earnings estimates for S&amp;P 500 companies may still need to be adjusted downward amidst ongoing tariff uncertainty. The SPY ETF remains lower by 0.26% as of late morning trading. BofA: Stock Market Sentiment Is Looking Up 10:29 am by Gerelyn Terzo A recent report from Bank of America indicates a notable shift in broader stock market sentiment. The firm&#8217;s equity risk-love indicator has now transitioned from a state of deep panic recorded last month to a neutral reading in its latest assessment. Historically, such an improvement often signals that stocks may soon retest their previous record-high levels. The SPY ETF is currently down a slight 0.30%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets opened on a subdued note across the board this morning, with all three of the major stock market averages edging lower. If the S&amp;P 500 can turn it around like it did yesterday, it will mark its seventh-straight winning session for the broader market index. The SPY ETF remains lower by a slight 0.30%. After Moody&#8217;s cut the U.S. debt rating by one notch, Deutsche Bank responded with its assessment that the U.S. economy is experiencing a &#8220;death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds. Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Jim Reid wrote, “Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.” Despite the broader market&#8217;s struggles, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is an outlier, climbing 3% and offering some counterweight to the losses seen in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. Tesla boss Elon Musk vowed to remain at the helm of the EV maker for the next five years. On the Dow, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has indicated it won&#8217;t pass tariff-related costs onto consumers, a different approach compared to fellow Dow component Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which had earlier signaled price increases. Here’s a look at the performance as of mid-morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 98.87 (-0.23%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 95.66 (-0.49%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.48 (-0.33%) Market Movers Quantum computing stocks are capturing attention. D-Wave Quantum (Nasdaq: QBTS) surged as much as 20% this morning after launching its newest quantum computing system. The company&#8217;s Advantage2 system, now accessible via the cloud, represents its most powerful offering yet, boasting enhanced energy efficiency and reduced noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is adding 3.3% to its value today, nearing its 52-week high. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is shedding 3.2% of its value, and Airbnb (Nasdaq: ABNB) is down 3.1% following an order from Spain to delist tens of thousands of short-term rental properties.

Among those that have already reported, more than three-quarters (78%) of S&amp;P 500 companies posted a positive EPS surprise, while close to two-thirds (62%) also beat their revenue projections. This positive trend, however, is tempered by a warning from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who cautions that Wall Street&#8217;s earnings estimates on S&amp;P 500 companies have further to decline given persistent tariff uncertainty. The SPX ETF remains lower by 0.42%. Stock Market Outlook: BofA 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Bank of America, investor sentiment regarding the wider stock market has seen an uptick. The Wall Street firm&#8217;s equity risk-love indicator, which showed deep panic just last month, has most recently registered a neutral position. Should the pattern persist, this positive change suggests that equities could soon move to challenge their all-time highs. The SPX ETF remains lower by 0.35%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets began the day on a weaker footing today, largely giving back the slight advances seen yesterday. Yesterday&#8217;s session was notable for extending the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s winning streak to six straight days, with both the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also moving into positive territory. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.35% as of mid-morning trading. Moody&#8217;s downgraded the U.S. debt rating, prompting Deutsche Bank to declare the U.S. economy is experiencing a &#8220;death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; But the outlook also suggests the U.S. economy is at the tail end of that downward spiral. Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid wrote in a note, “Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.” Amidst the overall declines, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stands out, gaining 3% and helping to cushion the drops in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. Dow component Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has signaled it won&#8217;t be passing on tariff-related expenses to customers, a contrasting strategy to Walmart (NYSE: WMT), another Dow component, which had previously indicated such plans before the White House urged them otherwise. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 58.88 (-0.14%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 59.95 (-0.31%) S&amp;P 500: Down 12.18 (-0.20%) Market Movers The quantum computing sector is making headlines, driven by D-Wave Quantum (Nasdaq: QBTS), which saw its shares jump by up to 20%. This surge follows the release of its latest quantum computing system, the Advantage2, now available through the cloud. The company highlights this as its most potent quantum offering to date, featuring improved energy performance and lower operational noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is up 3.3% and inching closer to its 52-week high. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is losing 3.2% of its value. Airbnb (Nasdaq: ABNB) is down 3.1% after Spanish authorities mandated the removal of numerous short-term rental listings.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values. He said at an event in New York, “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think” they can&#8230;“My own view is people feel pretty good because you haven’t [yet] seen effective tariffs&#8230;The market came down 10%, [it’s] back up 10%; that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.&#8221; Ray Dalio Comments on US Debt 11:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, reportedly raised a flag that Moody&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating misses a crucial point regarding the vulnerability of U.S. Treasuries. According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18. Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a significant gainer, soaring 25.9% following regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares are lower by 4.4% on the back of an analyst downgrade. Take-Two Interactive Software (Nasdaq: TTWO) is bucking the trend, climbing 3.7% after a price target increase from Wedbush Securities.

Walmart (WMT) shares slumped in early trading Monday after President Donald Trump said the retailer should absorb the cost of tariffs rather than pass it on to customers by raising prices. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,” Trump said in a Saturday message on Truth Social. “Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Shares of Walmart slid about 2% before the opening bell. The stock is up about 9% in 2025. Trump’s post came in response to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warning that profits could fall this year depending on the direction of trade policy. “Given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” McMillon said during the company’s earnings call Thursday, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. McMillon credited President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for “progress” on lowering tariffs after the U.S. and China agreed to roll back import taxes for a period of 90 days. “We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,” the CEO added.

Dimon pointed to the unpredictable nature of tariffs as a key area of uncertainty, while the bank’s chief U.S. economist has attached a less than 50% chance of a recession. Dimon told Bloomberg, &#8220;If there’s a recession, I don’t know how big it will be or how long it will last. Hopefully we’ll avoid it, but I wouldn’t take it off the table at this point.&#8221; Shielding Consumers 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo While some retailers like Walmart are discussing higher prices for consumers due to tariffs, data on producer prices suggests a broader trend of cost absorption. April saw a significant 0.5% decrease in producer prices, the most substantial drop in five years. This indicates that U.S. producers are largely bearing the brunt of increased costs, protecting consumers from immediate price hikes, a finding that significantly undershot Bloomberg economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The stock market has opened with a cautious tone this morning, as the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500 are all trading lower. The SPX index is down 0.37%. Investors are reacting to concerning statements made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at an economic forum earlier today. Powell warned of potentially higher long-term interest rates for the long term, owing in part to an uncertain monetary policy outlook. Today&#8217;s pullback follows an impressive run for the broader stock market in which the S&amp;P 500 has been retaking lost ground for a positive year-to-date performance. For its part, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has recovered 6% over the past five trading sessions. Today Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) will distribute it quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share to shareholders. Here&#8217;s the early look at market performance: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 114.29 (-0.27%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 128.16 (-0.67%) S&amp;P 500: Down 13.30 (-0.23%) Stocks in Focus Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is trading down by 4.0% following an announcement from a company executive that the retailer plans to transfer tariff costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, with these increases potentially taking effect this month. Shares of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) have tumbled by 6.5% today after the company reported disappointing revenue figures for its fiscal fourth quarter. Networking solutions provider Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) is also seeing downward pressure, with its stock down 4.2%. CoreWeave (Nasdaq: CRWV) is under pressure, falling by 4.4%, despite announcing strong first-quarter revenue and significant demand for its AI cloud platform,. Investors appear concerned by the company&#8217;s plans for aggressive capex plans in Q2. On the positive side, CoreWeave clinched a lucrative partnership with Google. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is a major drag on the markets, falling 17% today in a series of setbacks, the latest of which is a potential Medicare controversy.

I'll never forget my first airport lounge experience. I was 26, on a work trip to Austin, when my boss waved me into the Delta Sky Club as his guest. I tried to act cool -- like I belonged there -- but inside, I was buzzing like a kid in a candy store. Free drinks, gourmet snacks, fancy bathrooms, lightning-fast wifi…it felt like a whole different world.After that trip I learned that getting into airport lounges isn't actually that hard. Holding the right credit card can get you access to more than 1,400 lounges worldwide -- no boss required.Today, two of the best cards for VIP travel perks (including lounge access) are The Platinum Card® from American Express (see rates and fees) and the Chase Sapphire Reserve® (see rates and fees). We'll break down the differences so you can determine which is best for you this year.

Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.

In my eyes, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card has higher earning opportunities for everyday spending. With its slightly lower fee of $550, it may be a better fit for those who like to stretch their travel budget a bit further.What I love about the Amex Platinum CardIf you're looking for the full VIP experience, The Platinum Card® from American Express is tough to beat. The access to Centurion Lounges alone make those long layovers actually enjoyable. Terms apply. I've eaten full meals, drunk plenty of mimosas, and even showered once before a long-haul flight -- all thanks to the airport lounge perks included with my card membership.Hotel elite status is an underrated perk. Just by having the card, you can get room upgrades, early check-ins, and late checkouts at Hilton and Marriott properties. Terms apply; enrollment may be required.One low-key perk that I love is the $100 Saks Fifth Avenue credit. Terms apply. I use this to buy my wife fancy gifts each year (one for her birthday in July and one in December for Christmas!).If you're a frequent traveler who loves a first-class vibe, consider applying for The Platinum Card® from American Express here (see rates and fees).What I love about Chase Sapphire ReserveIf you want premium perks and serious bang for your buck, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® delivers the goods. First off, the $300 annual travel credit is almost effortless to use. (Plus, it makes up for over half the annual fee.)Point redemptions are where Chase Sapphire Reserve® truly crushes it. Your points are worth 50% more when you book through Chase Travel. That's up to $900 in travel value from a welcome offer of 60,000 bonus points (after spending $5,000 in the first 3 months).And you get 10x total points on hotels and car rentals through Chase Travel℠ immediately after the first $300 is spent on travel purchases annually, 5x total points on air travel through Chase Travel℠ immediately after the first $300 is spent on travel purchases annually, and 3x points on other travel and dining. It's easy to see how everyday spending can stack up points really fast.If you want a practical card without giving up great travel perks, apply for the Chase Sapphire Reserve® here (see rates and fees).Final verdict: Which card should you pick?If you're chasing luxury experiences -- and you'll actually use lounge access, hotel upgrades, and airline credits -- the Amex Platinum Card is your ticket to a VIP summer.If you want to maximize value per dollar and score easy rewards on everything from Uber rides to steak dinners, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® probably fits your style better.",https://www.fool.com/money/credit-cards/articles/amex-platinum-vs-chase-sapphire-reserve-which-card-wins-for-summer-travel/

Americans haven’t stopped spending despite broad economic uncertainty. But a close look at recent data and trends has fed concerns about a slowdown. The unemployment rate is relatively low, and job creation is holding steady. Retail spending shot up 6.8% year-over-year in April, the National Retail Federation said, exclusive of car and gas purchases. But Americans are increasingly uneasy, several measures suggest. Consumer sentiment fell in April for a fourth straight month, according to the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Quick-service restaurants and companies selling everything from lunch to laundry detergent say their customers seem squeezed. And while credit and debit card spending ticked up 1% last month, according to Bank of America, there was a pullback in big splurges like trips and hotels. Two releases set for Thursday will offer fresh data: Walmart (WMT) is slated to hand in its first-quarter numbers, and the government is scheduled to publish April retail data. Trade negotiations, notably with China, ahve contributed to the uncertainty: Widespread “reciprocal” tariffs are not slated to take effect for weeks, but the NRFthinks the threat of higher import taxes has spurred consumers to stock up on some items, juicing retail spending in April. “There’s a real inconsistency in the vibe,” said Max Levchin, CEO of buy now, pay later provider Affirm (AFRM), on CNBC Friday. “People are stressed out about the economy, yet they’re shopping. They’re buying, and they’re paying their bills.” Shoppers Look for Lower Sticker Prices Oppenheimer analysts on Wednesday said Walmart has historically performed well in recessionary periods. Still, they acknowledged the current outlook can be hard to read. “We have seen potentially mixed consumer data-points lately with still healthy consumer spending trends overall,” they wrote. “But at the same time, [there has been] more downbeat [consumer packaged goods company] commentary.” Consumers have “a lot to process” and a reason to “pause,” Procter & Gamble (PG) CFO Andre Schulten said last month. The parent company of brands like Tide and Febreze recently downgraded its outlook for the full fiscal year. So did another consumer goods giant, Church & Dwight (CHD). Americans are watching their tabs at Applebee’s and IHOP and cutting back at Wendy’s (WEN) and McDonald’s (MCD), executives recently said. At grocery and convenience stores, some shoppers are focusing more on sticker prices than the cost-per-serving, which has prompted Pepsi (PEP) and Mondelēz International (MDLZ) to offer smaller packages at lower price points, executives said last month. “While two, three years ago consumers would easily pay above $4 for a pack of biscuits, we’re now seeing that we need to be below $4, and ideally below $3,” said Dirk Van de Put, CEO of Mondelēz, which counts Ritz Crackers and Oreo cookies as parts of its biscuit category. Demand hasn’t waned for international airfare or luxury clothing, companies said. Households with six-figure incomes have been flocking to Walmart’s delivery service in recent months. “We’re seeing higher engagement across income cohorts, with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of share gains,” CFO John David Rainey said this winter.

By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk.

The ETF&#8217;s 3.7% yield and ultra-low 0.06% expense ratio make it cost-effective while limiting sector exposure to no more than 25% ensures diversification.

With tariff&#8217;s top-of-mind for investors these days, the ETF&#8217;s U.S.-focused holdings provide resilience against global disruptions. Its proven track record and low costs makes VYM a foundational ETF for steady dividend income and long-term wealth building. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG) targets companies with over 10 years of dividend increases, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and holds 338 stocks in its portfolio. The ETF&#8217;s 1.8% yield is lower, but its focus on dividend growth drives an 11.2% annualized return over the past decade. VIG&#8217;s 0.05% expense ratio is also among the lowest, maximizing investor returns. The Vanguard dividend ETF’s tech- and consumer-heavy portfolio suits investors prioritizing capital appreciation alongside income. And for investors looking for exposure to stable, growing firms, VIG cushions against economic uncertainty. It&#8217;s another ETF sporting a blend of growth and income, making it a versatile choice for investors seeking a balance of dividends and upside potential. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO) The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:DGRO) tracks the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, holding over 400 stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and emphasizes its consistent dividend growth. DGRO sports a 2.3% yield and 0.08% expense ratio, offering a balanced income stream and a 16.4% annualized return over five years. The ETF&#8217;s diversified sector exposure, including financials and healthcare, minimizes risk. In today&#8217;s volatile market, the ETF&#8217;s focus on resilient, dividend-growing companies counters the extreme swings the market is experiencing. DGRO’s low cost and steady performance make it an excellent choice for investors seeking dependable income with moderate growth in a challenging economic landscape. ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) The last dividend ETF to consider is ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEARCA:NOBL), which tracks the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. It holds over 60 stocks, each with over 25 years of dividend increases, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW). With a 2.5% yield and 0.35% expense ratio, it reflects NOBL&#8217;s premium quality, which has generated 14.5% annualized returns over the last five years. The ETF&#8217;s equal-weighted approach also reduces concentration risk, while its focus on elite dividend payers ensures stability. NOBL’s defensive holdings, with a long history of thriving amid uncertainty, offer investors reliable payouts. For those prioritizing quality and consistency, NOBL’s proven resilience makes it a stellar long-term holding for passive income.

WMT,2025-05-08 10:06:00,Upstart Aced Earnings but Still Got Crushed. Time to Buy the Dip?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/upstart-aced-earnings-but-still-got-crushed-time-to-20250508.jpg,https://www.fool.com,"Investors came in to Upstart's (UPST 1.79%) first-quarter earnings report hoping the company would maintain its momentum from the end of last year. Its growth has accelerated thanks to a new artificial intelligence (AI) model, Model 18 or M18, that has significantly improved its conversion rate thanks to an even broader prediction set that includes approximately 1 million predictions per applicant, or six times its prior model. With those tailwinds behind it, Upstart's results in Q1 did not disappoint. Revenue jumped 67% to $213.4 million, which topped estimates at $201.3 million. Those results included 34% growth in revenue from fees to $185.5 million, and Upstart benefited from a decline in fair value adjustments on its loans, indicating better credit performance. Underlying growth in its business was especially impressive as loan originations rose 102% to 240,706 loans, and total originations jumped 89% to more than $2.1 billion. The conversion rate continued to improve, rising from 14% to 19.1%, all signs that adoption is growing rapidly. Its metrics on the bottom line also improved. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) improved from a loss of $20.3 million to a profit of $42.6 million. It nearly reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, finishing the quarter with a loss of $2.4 million, up from a loss of $64.6 million in the quarter a year ago. It reported an adjusted per-share profit of $0.30, ahead of the consensus at $0.17, and up from an adjusted per-share loss of $0.31 in the quarter a year ago. Despite the strong Q1 earnings report, Upstart essentially reiterated its full-year guidance untouched as it guided to revenue of $225 million for Q2, below the consensus at $226.3 million. Wall Street tends to see a beat without a raise as a sign that the current momentum won't last, and investors sometimes punish growth stocks for that pattern. As a result, the stock was down 16% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. While management did acknowledge the uncertainty in the economy, there wasn't anything in the guidance to indicate weakness. Meanwhile, a number of indicators in the business showed it continuing to strengthen. Upstart has diversified its business away from unsecured consumer loans in recent years as auto loans grew by five times to $61 million in the quarter and up 42% from Q4. Home loan origination jumped six times to $41 million, and management noted on the earnings call that its lending partners greatly prefer secured loans to unsecured loans, which bodes well for continued growth in the business. Prior to the earnings release, the company announced a one-year strategic partnership with OnePay, a fintech majority owned by Walmart. Upstart said the partnership would help it market lending product to Walmart's customer base, a massive opportunity for the company. It also plans to offer co-branded products without OnePay, though it said it didn't expect the partnership to have a material impact on financial results this year. Additionally, Upstart announced a forward-flow commitment from Fortress Investment Group, which agreed to purchase up to $1.2 billion in loans originated on Upstart, which will further diversify the company's base of lending partners and help ensure adequate funding for its loans. If the after-hours sell-off holds, Upstart now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 31 based on adjusted earnings, and that number is likely to fall as analysts up their forecasts following the strong quarter. Meanwhile, Upstart's revenue growth and the tailwinds in the large auto and home loan markets show it still has a significant growth runway in front of it. Upstart's own proprietary data even shows the macroenvironment improving modestly, and the business is less at risk of turmoil in the credit market than it was in 2022 when interest rates surged, freezing borrower demand. With interest rates already high and Upstart's business now resilient, the company seems to be in good shape no matter what happens on the macrofront. A recession could even be a positive for the company as it could lower interest rates. Overall, Upstart's business is getting stronger, its technology is improving, and the valuation looks attractive. The company also has scheduled an ""AI day"" when it will present technology updates and discuss its business model and strategy.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/08/upstart-aced-earnings-but-still-got-crushed-time-t/

With all the different perks and benefits available today, it makes perfect sense to shop around and find who offers the best deal. Key Points This Redditor is looking for a great combination of general and travel card. Sadly, they don’t want to live in a cash-back world. There are a few really strong recommendations that are worth considering. The right travel credit card can take you to places you’ve never dreamed of. Click here now to see our top picks. (Sponsor) This is precisely the situation with one Redditor posting on r/CreditCards, as they are looking to find the card that best matches their goals and travel needs. This individual is looking at travel as their primary goal, so all efforts here will be about earning miles and points. It’s a little confusing that the Redditor wants a card that excels for both general and travel purposes, as most cards do one or the other really well, but there is no harm in trying to find something that works. The Criteria With an income of over $300,000 and a FICO score of 800, this Redditor hopes to get a solid travel card that allows them to use points for domestic and international travel. Currently, they are okay with category-specific cards but do not favor rotating-category cards, which knocks some of the more popular cashback cards off the board. While they only travel once per year, either domestically or internationally, they have an international trip already planned, so it would be ideal to have a card they could use to rack up some points this year. As far as expenses, they have their once-yearly travel plans, a $5,000 monthly mortgage, a $500 HOA, and $350 in monthly utilities, none of which are paid by card. There is also a Costco membership, but this really isn’t a factor, and they already have a Costco Citi Visa, BoA unlimited cash rewards, BoA customized cash rewards, and a Discover card. So, after considering the AMEX Platinum and Bilt cards, they are still waiting to find something better. However, it’s worth noting that in the comments, they clarify that they are okay with an annual fee and the option to downgrade if they find themselves traveling less. The Options AMEX Platinum Among the top recommended options is a card that the original poster is already considering. The American Express Platinum card has a $695 annual fee, which is a definite negative, but it also has many bonuses to help offset this charge. However, before getting into the benefits, it&#8217;s worth knowing that the attractive 80,000 membership reward point bonus requires $8,000 in eligible purchases over 6 months. While we don’t know precisely what the Redditor spends monthly, this should be manageable based on their overall income and general spending habits. With this card, you get a $155 Walmart+ credit, a $200 hotel credit every year, a $240 digital entertainment credit, and a $200 airline fee credit, which means the $695 annual fee is offset by $900 in value when you also get a $15 Uber Cash credit every month. Capital One Venture X Another solid option for this Redditor might be the Capital One Venture X card. While it has a $395 annual fee, it offers a $300 annual travel credit, a $120 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit, 10,000 bonus miles (equivalent to $100) every year, and 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $4,000 in the first three months. Earning 10X miles on hotel and car rentals, 5X miles on flights, and 2X miles on all other purchases, this Redditor should have more than enough time to spend and save for their once-yearly big trip. Plus, you get access to more than 1,300 lounges, which could be beneficial if and when the original poster goes international and wants a nicer place to sit and wait for their flight. Chase Sapphire Preferred Among Chase’s best cards, this one offers an outstanding balance between general and travel spending, making it a top option. The Chase Sapphire Preferred has a $95 annual fee but offers 100,000 bonus points with just $5,000 in spending after 90 days, a pretty strong bonus overall. In addition, you get $200 in partner value from Chase partners, $50 statement credits every year when booking through Chase Travel, and 25% more value when rewards are redeemed for travel. To earn rewards, you can earn 2X on all travel purchases, 3X on dining out or taking in, 3X points on grocery purchases, and 3X on streaming services, so rewards can quickly add up.

With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it’s concerning that this isn’t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it’s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy’s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I’m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You’ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster’s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One’s layout is far easier to navigate, but it’s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn’t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache. The post Why Do Chase Shopping Offers Feel Blah Compared to Capital One&#8217;s 100+ Deals? appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/personal-finance/2025/04/15/why-do-chase-shopping-offers-feel-blah-compared-to-capital-ones-100-deals/

Joliet police arrested Eric Watkins and released him on a notice to appear for the crime of public indecency. Public indecency is not a detainable crime in Illinois under the SAFE-T-Act. According to Joliet police spokesman Dwayne English, at 10:23 a.m. Saturday, officers responded to the Walmart at 2424 W. Jefferson St. for a public indecency complaint. English said officers learned that a female customer was approached by a man, later identified as Watkins, who asked her if she would assist him with shopping for items. At one point, police said that as the woman retrieved an item from the shelf at the request of the man, she saw he had his genitalia exposed. The victim then walked away and notified Walmart staff, who contacted the Joliet Police Department. Watkins left the store and fled the area in a vehicle, English said. The registration of the vehicle was ascertained as Watkins left, and police learned he possibly lived in Romeoville. A short time later, officers with the Romeoville Police Department located Watkins at his residence, police said. Joliet officers traveled to Romeoville and placed Watkins into custody without incident.",https://www.patch.com/illinois/joliet/flasher-inside-joliet-walmart-exposes-himself-customer-police

Economists predict that these tariffs will affect everything from groceries to car prices. With Americans already reeling from high prices at the grocery store, finding lower grocery prices may have a significant impact on your wallet. Economists predict the groceries that are likely to be the most impacted include fruits and vegetables imported from other countries, maple syrup, avocados, and imported alcohol such as beer, whiskey, and tequila. Walmart may be known for discount prices, but it&#8217;s not the only store that offers consumers great value. At 24/7 Wall St., we took a deep dive to find eight discount grocers across the country that can compete, or even go lower than Walmart&#8217;s prices. Read on for where you can find the best deals in your area. (This article was updated on April 2, 2025, to reflect recent economic news regarding the rising cost of products after President Trump&#8217;s newly imposed tariffs.) Why We&#8217;re Covering This Now Economists warn that already high grocery prices will continue to rise under President Trump&#8217;s new tariff plans. No one wants to break the bank when it comes to shopping for groceries and other everyday items. This is especially true today, as inflation is on the rise and prices are higher than ever (especially groceries!) But even though Walmart offers competitive low prices, you might not always be getting the best deals. 8. Market Basket Market Basket offers a lot of value for its customer base. Location: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island Number of Locations: 95 Known for: Being one of the least expensive groceries in the New England area, with a “more for your dollar” slogan Best things to buy: New England fish items like clams, fresh seafood, maple syrup, pears, apples More in Your Basket There is something special about Market Basket pricing. According to a recent study, Market Basket&#8217;s pricing was 18% lower than that of other Boston-area groceries. This study found that a family spending $250 per week on groceries could save as much as $2,300 annually by shopping at Market Basket. The privately owned business heavily focuses on keeping prices down, which has helped Market Basket earn a reputation as one of the cheapest grocery stores in the U.S. 7. Food 4 Less Food 4 Less is more than living up to its name. Location: California, Illinois, Indiana Number of locations: 101 Known for: A no-frills grocery store where customers bag their groceries Best things to buy: Organic orange juice, cage-free brown eggs, vegetable chips, and organic creamy peanut butter A Kroger Brand Food 4 Less is backed by its parent company, Kroger. Located in just four states, the Kroger-owned Food 4 Less brand is quickly becoming a go-to choice for customers looking for inexpensive groceries. These locations sell dry goods, canned goods, baking supplies, and organic and non-organic produce for less. The same can be said for health and beauty items, though Walmart has a larger selection overall. 6. H-E-B H-E-B is a bona fide Texas staple. Location: Texas and Mexico Number of locations: 400 Known for: Being region-specific to just Texas, with 380 stores in Texas and a few dozen in Mexico Best things to buy: Whataburger sauces, Texas-branded products, Taste of San Antonio, fajitas, tortillas, and more Better in Texas H-E-B offers food items you can&#8217;t find at your local Walmart. As Texans believe everything is better in Texas, this might be true if you shop at a H-E-B grocery store. Considered one of the best privately owned groceries in the country, H-E-B pricing compares very well to Walmart while offering things you can’t get at any Walmart location. However, where H-E-B truly wins is its low-priced yet outstanding quality meats and produce, which Walmart cannot match. 5. Lidl Lidl is attempting to enter the US market. Location: Eastern U.S. Number of locations: 185 Known for: Fantastic selection of low-price items, including store-brand items, which account for 80% of the store’s inventory Best things to buy: Seafood and dairy, organic meats, organic fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and fair-trade chocolates Store-Branded Everything With its competitive pricing, Lidl will grow quickly in the US. Another international brand trying to carve out a niche in the United States, Lidl is already well on its way to success. With 185 stores and growing, Lidl beats out Walmart in the idea that over 80% of the items in Lidl stores are store-branded. This means they are cheaper than brand-name items and even cheaper than Walmart’s private-label brands. Ultimately, Lidl is cheaper and healthier with grass-fed meats, organic fruits and vegetables, and organic dairy products. 4. WinCo Foods WinCo Foods is a surprisingly delightful place to shop due to its pricing. Location: Western U.S. Number of locations: 141 Known for: Midwest-based employee-owned grocery store with more than 20,000 employees Best things to buy: Boxed foods, dairy products, and bulk cheeses are said to save customers a lot of money The Midwest Surprise You won&#8217;t be disappointed with the price when you enter WinCo Foods. With only 141 employee-owned locations in the Midwest, many Americans can’t walk into a WinCo Foods store. However, for those who can, the bulk purchase area in its stores can be vastly cheaper than Walmart. Everything from Arizona Iced Tea, soft drinks, eggs, spices, smoked and grilled items, and barbecue charcoal is cheaper than at Walmart. This is a testament to the employee-owned nature of WinCo Foods, as they are focused on inexpensive pricing and not driving big profits. 3. Costco Shopping at Costco offers a unique experience compared to Walmart. Location: Throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 627 Known for: Bulk purchases, exclusive items under the Kirkland brand, regional inventory Best things to buy: Frozen foods, lunch items, fresh food, baking, and cooking essentials Buying In Bulk Buying in bulk at Costco can be much less expensive than at Walmart. Costco’s pricing can be better than Walmart&#8217;s in multiple categories if you like to stock up on items simultaneously. It’s widely considered cheaper to purchase fresh food and frozen foods, and even some staples like milk and eggs can be less expensive at Costco. However, when you buy in bulk, Costco shines. Even though you will pay more upfront, you’ll restock less, which makes things like paper towels and toilet paper less expensive than Walmart. 2. Aldi Aldi beats Walmart in price in multiple categories, such as daily food staples. Location: 40 states throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 2,489 Known for: No-frills shopping experience with numerous private-label products Best things to buy: German foods, baking ingredients, basic food staples, pre-cooked frozen foods The German Giant Aldi offers a no-frills grocery shopping experience. Aldi is expected to have close to 3,200 locations by 2028, making it a formidable competitor to Walmart’s grocery business. Compared to Walmart, there is an expectation that you should be able to walk out of Aldi for at least a few dollars less than you would spend at Walmart if you took a list of the same items. Fans of the brand love it for basic food staples like milk and eggs, as well as foreign food items you can’t get at Walmart. 1. Target Target&#8217;s house brands are competitively priced compared to Walmart&#8217;s. Location: Throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 1,978 Known for: High-quality, low-priced items across food, clothing, beauty, and more Best things to buy: Up &amp; Up cleaning products, deal-worthy essentials Walmart’s Biggest Competitor Target is consistently looking to beat Walmart&#8217;s pricing. When you think of Walmart and competition, it goes without saying that Target is at the very top of the list. While Walmart is generally considered the less expensive of the two, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of items where Target beats Walmart, including bottled water and house-branded cleaning supplies. In many cases, Target’s Cat &amp; Jack brand also offers better pricing for kids’ clothing.

Here are some of my biggest wins.",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/im-27-and-have-i-have-33000-in-a-20250313.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Retirement doesn&#8217;t have to be someone&#8217;s number-one priority as they get started on their professional journeys in their early-20s. That said, after one has settled into a new career, starting the retirement saving journey can put your head and shoulders above the crowd, as you aim to retire more comfortably. Furthermore, if you&#8217;re miles ahead in the game, perhaps the door to an early retirement (think the FIRE movements) could open, giving you more options as you shoot to achieve financial freedom. Of course, there are numerous early retirement success stories on Reddit, with a number of Millennials and Gen X&#8217;ers boasting nest eggs sizeable enough to retire well before the traditional (think Social Security-eligible age) finish line. Of course, an earlier retirement will be &#8220;leaner&#8221; (think less extravagant spending) than if you&#8217;d retired later. Either way, the key is staying ahead and taking advantage of any 401(k) matches an employer may offer. In this piece, we&#8217;ll explore the case of a 27-year-old who&#8217;s faring quite well, with $33,000 saved up in a Roth and close to $50,000 in the 401(k), comprising an impressive net worth of just north of the $100,000 mark. This relatively young over-achiever shared their biggest wins on Reddit. For the young readers striving to get ahead at a young age, here are the most important takeaways, at least in my view. Key Points This 27-year-old over-achiever is off to a hot start. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in their well-balanced $100k portfolio. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Keeping contributions consistent and investing in the steady blue-chips Having a look at their portfolio, it&#8217;s clear they&#8217;re not investing like many people in their age group. Indeed, someone in their late-20s would probably be likelier to speculate on the hot tech stock of the day in search of the next timely double. Instead, the Reddit user seems to have opted for &#8220;boring&#8221; stocks that, I believe, are more common in the portfolio of a much older investor (think a retiree). Indeed, investing with such a balanced approach at a young age can be a wise long-term move, given stocks don&#8217;t always go up — something many market newcomers discovered in the Trump 2.0 term. So, what&#8217;s at the core of their portfolio? First, there&#8217;s quite a bit of index funds in there, with low-cost S&amp;P 500 ETFs topping the list. Pretty solid blue chips make up the core of this portfolio With a bit of Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) sprinkled on top, the Reddit user has a nice balance of growth and stability. Looking further under the hood, we see some rock-solid blue-chip names like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) — staples for many retirees. However, it&#8217;s not all boring retiree-friendly stocks. The Reddit user has a mix of &#8220;growthier&#8221; Magnificent Seven names — like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) — to balance things out. Overall, it&#8217;s a very well-rounded and balanced portfolio that looks like it can hold up in this market hailstorm. As the market turns lower, here&#8217;s hoping the Reddit user adds to fallen positions on weakness. Indeed, the first $100,000 is just the start, as they embark on a multi-decade journey towards (early) retirement. Personally, I&#8217;d suggest adding more to index funds (S&amp;P 500 or the QQQ) on further weakness to simplify things. A correction has struck, making it a great time to top-up on low-cost index funds, especially since the market is moving faster than one can keep up with a rather long list of individual names. As for the other names, I&#8217;d encourage the investor to do their own homework and pare positions that have become overbought. For instance, 3M and CAT stand out as names that may make sense to take profits in. The bottom line This self-guided Reddit user acts as a great example for how new investors should go about beginning their retirement journeys. They&#8217;ve got a balanced portfolio and seem well-equipped to win at the long-term game! Though they&#8217;re a tad light on tech compared to most other young people, I do think they&#8217;re well-insulated from a bursting of an AI bubble — that is, if one even exists.The post I&#8217;m 27 and have I have $33,000 in a Roth and $48,000 in my 401K.

WMT,2025-03-13 11:35:39,The Most Expensive Failed Startups of All Time,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-most-expensive-failed-startups-of-all-time-20250313.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the history of the business world, it should go without saying that far more companies fail than succeed. This is an unfortunate truth, with as many as 20% of new businesses failing in their first year, 50% within 5 years and 65% within 10 years. Only 35% of companies, or around one-third according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, can celebrate a ten-year mark. Key Points It&#8217;s an unfortunate truth that more startups fail than succeed. The hope is that you don&#8217;t expand too quickly without ensuring a solid business foundation. Sometimes, ideas are too early to market, as Webvan shows, as grocery delivery is now widespread. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) The most challenging point for some businesses, especially founders and CEOs, is that their failures are very public. It’s one thing to fail and disappoint yourself and your family, but it’s an entirely different thing to fail on a global scale, let go of employees, and see yourself in headlines worldwide. 10. Pets.com Founded: 1998 Defunct: 2000 Amount lost: $110 million Why it failed: An unsustainable business model based on too high shipping costs The Dot-Com Burst The poster child for the dot-com era going bust, Pets.com was a company born in 1998 and with its massive war chest of startup money, it looked to conquer the pet product delivery market. On the positive side, Pets.com saw an influx of customer activity and orders, but company management spent too much on advertising before the company was bringing in enough revenue. As a result, the company went defunct after just two short years and while it may not be the most expensive failed startup, it’s one of the most memorable. 9. Anki Founded: 2010 Defunct: 2019 Amount lost: $205 million Why it failed: High-profile promise that was unable to meet customer expectations Robots For All The promise of Anki was a welcome one as an American robotics and AI startup that manufactured small robots for children. After receiving over $200 million in investments, the hope was that robots like Cozmo and Vector had emotional intelligence, making them a more ideal play “toy” for children. Unfortunately, the company failed to secure its last round of financing and its only place on the market was a palm-size toy that provided gibberish chitchat with children. 8. Abound Solar Founded: 2007 Defunct: 2012 Amount lost: $614 million Why it failed: Unproven technology and high costs were too much for the solar industry Affordable Solar Panels One of two solar startups to rank among the most expensive failed startups of all time, Abound Solar lost its investors almost $614 million over five years. In an industry where price is everything, Abound Solar didn’t have the right technology or at least reliable enough technology to reduce costs low enough to meet customer demand. Separately, this company should be a lesson on not relying too heavily on government subsidies that don’t help businesses avoid marketplace realities. 7. Webvan Founded: 1996 Defunct: 2001 Amount lost: $800 million Why it failed: Didn’t have the correct scale to match an overly ambitious delivery rollout service Groceries To Your Door The idea of door-to-door grocery delivery is a fantastic one that hits all the right spots today with services like Instacart, Shipt, and Walmart+. However, before these services, Webvan tried out a similar business starting in 1999, but it expanded too fast without building up the right amount of demand. Unfortunately, it spent a ton of money without a solid customer base and profits to sustain its quick growth. In other words, Webvan should have tested demand in a few markets before expanding. 6. Theranos Founded: 2003 Defunct: 2018 Amount invested: $700 million &#8211; $1.4 billion Why it failed: Inaccurate and misleading claims about technology Total Fraud Arguably the best-known name on this list, Theranos has become something of the poster-child for failed startups. With hundreds of millions in investments from some of the world’s wealthiest families like the Waltons, Carlos Slim, Betsy Devos, and more, Theranos promised a revolutionary blood-test process. Unfortunately, the technology wasn’t real and the company that was at one time worth $9 billion went up in smoke leaving investors holding the bag on everything and its CEO in jail. 5. Jawbone Founded: 1999 Defunct: 2017 Amount lost: $900 million Why it failed: Failure to properly market and sell its products Not So Wearable Before the Apple Watch helped solidify the wearable market once and for all, Jawbone attempted to do the same thing. Established in 1999, the company was heavily focused on wearables, Bluetooth headphones, and wireless speakers. Venture capitalists poured money into the company, giving it a $3.2 billion evaluation at its peak, but the best Jawbone could manage was only capturing 3% of the market by 2015 before it wound itself down in 2017. 4. Better Place Founded: 2007 Defunct: 2013 Amount lost: $850 &#8211; $900 million Why it failed: Mismanagement, increasing infrastructure costs The Pre-Tesla An electric vehicle startup founded by entrepreneur Shai Agassi in 2007, Better Place was poised to look as big, if not bigger, than Tesla. Raising between $850 and $900 million in capital, the company looked to build battery-swapping stations so users could extend the range of their cars. Unfortunately, infrastructure costs were high and the company couldn’t keep operations going indefinitely. 3. Solyndra Founded: 2005 Defunct: 2011 Amount lost: $1.2 billion Why it failed: Could not compete with conventional solar panel manufacturers The Solar Flare Out One of the most heavily promoted startups of all time, Solyndra seemed so promising that even the Obama administration offered them $535 million in loans alongside $1.2 billion in private fundraising. Unfortunately, timing is everything in the startup world, and Solyndra’s timing couldn’t have been worse in 2011, as prices tanked for many of the materials it needed to make its panels. As a result, the company folded and the hope for widespread solar technology along with it. 2. LeSports Founded: 2014 Defunct: 2017 Amount lost: $1.7 billion Why it failed: LeSports faced financial mismanagement while overpaying for broadcasting rights Streaming Failures With an investment of $1.7 billion, LeSports was poised to dominate the Hong Kong sports streaming industry. Backed by a cadre of big investors, the company suffered from poor management and aggressive expansion that left it unable to pay rent on its buildings at one point. The biggest lesson here is to ensure a sustainable revenue model before going to market and not to expand too quickly without ensuring profitability first. 1. Quibi Founded: 2018 Defunct: 2020 Amount lost: $1.75 billion Why it failed: Niche, mobile-only content didn’t resonate with the audience Most Expensive Of All-Time Widely considered the most expensive failed start-up of all time, Quibi couldn’t have been in a better place to succeed. With more than $1.75 billion invested, two massively well-known entertainment and business co-founders, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, the mobile-only short-form content didn’t resonate with audiences. Quibi was too early to market with 10-minute episodes. Unlike TikTok, which is creator-focused, Quibi was too close to traditional television, which was its ultimate downfall.

WMT,2025-03-11 11:37:09,"US tariffs fuel inflation, putting pressure on low-income households",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/us-tariffs-fuel-inflation-putting-pressure-on-lowincome-households-20250311.jpg,https://invezz.com,"With inflation already weighing heavily on American families, new tariffs on imported goods are set to intensify financial strain, particularly for low-income households. The impact of these levies—targeting everyday items like clothing, electronics, and groceries—will ripple through consumer spending habits and drive up costs in sectors where affordability is already a concern.Economists from Bank of America and BNP Paribas expect the February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report to provide the first clear indications of these tariffs&#8217; effect, with further increases anticipated in the coming months. As US retailers, including Target and Best Buy, brace for higher costs, long-term inflation expectations have climbed to near 30-year highs. The burden will fall hardest on those already struggling with rising living expenses, as businesses pass higher import costs onto consumers.Low-income consumers hit hardest by rising costsFamilies with tighter budgets, who typically allocate a larger share of their income to necessities, are particularly vulnerable to these price hikes. Goods sourced from China, Mexico, and Canada—such as furniture, fresh produce, and energy supplies—are becoming more expensive, compounding financial pressures on low-income consumers who have been dealing with high inflation and borrowing costs.Retail giants have already signaled that price increases are inevitable. Target CEO Brian Cornell has warned that tariffs on key imports, such as Mexican fruits and vegetables, will make it challenging to maintain stable pricing.Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, has also noted growing &#8220;stress behaviors&#8221; among budget-conscious shoppers, with some switching to smaller pack sizes or opting for less expensive alternatives. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Walmart has begun negotiating with Chinese suppliers, requesting price cuts of up to 10% to mitigate the effects of tariffs. However, such efforts may not be enough to shield customers from rising costs.Inflation concerns escalate as consumer spending slowsHigher import duties are expected to act as a hidden tax on consumers, further slowing already tepid spending growth. The Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book report has highlighted increased price sensitivity among shoppers, particularly for non-essential items.This shift in consumer behavior suggests that inflationary pressures are reshaping purchasing decisions, leading to a decline in demand for discretionary goods.David French, executive vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, has pointed out that these tariffs function as a &#8220;consumption tax,&#8221; disproportionately affecting lower-income families. Unlike traditional tax policies, these trade levies increase the cost of essential goods, making it harder for vulnerable households to maintain their standard of living.The economic consequences of these tariffs are particularly stark for households at the lower end of the income spectrum. Between February 2020 and June 2024, the poorest 20% of US households experienced an 8.3% faster rise in consumer prices compared to the wealthiest segment, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.This divergence in inflation rates has contributed to broader economic discontent, influencing voter sentiment in the 2024 election cycle.Trump’s tariff strategyDonald Trump’s current trade policies mark a significant shift from his first-term tariff approach, which initially focused on industrial materials like steel and aluminum. This time, the measures are far more aggressive, pushing average US tariff rates to their highest levels since World War II.The latest round of levies includes a broad array of consumer goods, raising concerns about prolonged inflationary effects.Despite the financial strain on households, the White House has defended the policy, arguing that tariffs will ultimately benefit American workers and businesses. A White House spokesperson stated that the administration’s strategy aims to &#8220;raise wages, create jobs, and expand investment,&#8221; dismissing concerns about short-term price increases as a &#8220;little disturbance&#8221; that the economy can absorb.However, for many American families already facing financial hardship, the reality is far more immediate. The combination of tariffs, stagnant wages, and existing economic pressures is making it increasingly difficult for some households to afford basic necessities.As the effects of these tariffs take hold, the question remains: how will struggling consumers navigate an economy where the cost of living continues to climb?The post US tariffs fuel inflation, putting pressure on low-income households appeared first on Invezz",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/11/us-tariffs-fuel-inflation-putting-pressure-on-low-income-households/

WMT,2025-03-10 11:01:22,You May End Up Paying More At Walmart,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/you-may-end-up-paying-more-at-walmart-20250310.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has a big problem. Tariffs of what could be 10% on some Chinese goods imported to the US will increase Walmart’s overall expenses substantially. The king of low priced retail may struggle to keep the title. About three quarters of Walmart’s suppliers are located in China. The world’s largest retailer counts on low cost manufacturing in China to allow it to offer its low retail prices while retaining good margins. Walmart has an expensive problem if tariffs bite. If it raises its merchandise prices customers may cut back spending, or shop elsewhere. Walmart has started to attack the tariff problem, although there is no certainty its plans will allow it to keep merchandise prices at current levels. According to Bloomberg, Walmart may be able to overcome a portions of the challenges. “Some suppliers, including producers of kitchenware and clothing, have been asked to lower their prices by as much as 10% per round of tariffs, essentially shouldering the full cost of Trump’s duties…”, the news service reports. However, another point is that Walmart’s China’s suppliers are already operating on razor thin margins. Walmart’s request may put China suppliers in the red. Walmart operates on thin margins already as well. In the most recent quarter, Walmart had revenue of $180.6 billion, and operation income of $7.9 billion. The operation margin is only 4.3%. The US Walmart margin is slightly better. Revenue was $125.3 billion and operating income of $6.5 billion which is 5.3%. Walmart will not get all of its suppliers to cut prices. That leaves it with a difficult choice. Should it risk charging higher prices and potentially losing customers? Or, should it keep prices the same and risk lower operating margins?

WMT,2025-03-03 12:31:02,Has Tipping Gotten Out of Hand? Here Are the Current Social Rules,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/has-tipping-gotten-out-of-hand-here-are-the-20250303.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"If you live in the United States and polled 100 people about something financial that has gotten out of hand lately, I hope tipping is the top answer. We now live in a world where businesses that would have never dreamed of asking for a tip, like a clothing retailer, ask for tips with every transaction. Key Points For better or worse, the tipping culture in America isn’t going anywhere. The reality is that the rise of digital checkouts has only made tipping more pervasive wherever you shop. There are some absolute rules and general guidelines for how much to leave as a tip. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) The massive shift in tipping culture now begs the question of what the new social rules should be. What is the proper etiquette in different establishments? When should or shouldn’t you leave a tip? Unfortunately, the answer isn’t so easy. 20. Why Has Tipping Changed? Many places seem to blame the pandemic as tipping became integral to supporting essential workers. However, one of the more logical reasons is the rise of digital payment systems, which can display a tipping option right in front of customers before they complete their transaction. This has made it easy for businesses to make tipping a focal point of every purchase. 19. What Do Americans Really Think? Most discussions around the tipping culture change point back to a 2023 Pew Research poll that indicates over one-third of all Americans feel it’s “very easy” to know when to tip. Conversely, an equal number of people also claimed that they found it “not too easy or not at all easy” when asked if they know how much to tip in certain situations. Of the 12,000 respondents, 72% indicated they were being asked to tip more frequently than in the past. 18. Is Tipping Here To Say? By all accounts, tipping isn’t going anywhere, and we shouldn’t expect it to disappear overnight. Restaurants could start building the cost of tipping into their prices to pay servers a fair wage, but then higher food prices would turn away customers, so this isn’t a solution. While other countries may not rely so heavily on tipping, expect the US to rely on it for the foreseeable future. 17. Miscellaneous Roles Unsurprisingly, there are a host of roles where a tip might be something you consider but is not required. This might be a job like an exterminator, carpet installer, or window washer. Generally, $10 or $20 is acceptable in these cases, but you don’t need to exceed this number. In the case of a camp counselor or teacher, pool together money with the rest of the parents and provide one significant gift. 16. House Movers If you are moving homes, whether down the street or across the country, these individuals are lifting a lot, and potentially even packing for you. As a result, your tip should be hefty enough to make it meaningful, which is why 15% to 20% of the total move cost is appropriate. 15. Coat Check If you are in a place where a coat check is used, the acceptable norm is likely to be between $1 per coat and $2 if you have a bag. 14. Hotel Housekeeper This isn’t one of those roles that generally gets a tip as sometimes you may never see housekeepers’ work. However, if you can tip a housekeeper in a hotel, the rule of thumb is around $5 per night. 13. Salon At the salon, whether it’s a hair stylist, manicurist, or someone who provides facials, the same general rule is likely to apply. Upwards of 15% to 20% is the socially acceptable norm for any of these roles. 12. Baggage Handler At an airport or hotel, if you are providing your luggage to someone at the curb or inside a hotel lobby, it’s appropriate to generally tip around $1 to $2 per bag, depending on the number of bags. The same rule applies if you also hand your bags to someone at a cruise port. 11. Uber Drivers This applies to both Uber and Lyft, but this is another instance where the proper etiquette would be around 20% of the ride total. You might want to up this amount during a busy time like a concert or sports game where traffic is worse. 10. Grocery Delivery If you use something like Shipt or Walmart+ and have your groceries delivered, someone took a lot of time to get everything you wanted on your list. This is why experts say that 15% or 20% of the order total is the least you can tip. 9. Meal Delivery This is a controversial one as it depends on the kind of delivery driver. Your Amazon delivery driver? No tip is required, but the argument changes if it’s someone from DoorDash or GrubHub. This role is highly dependent on tips, and, as a result, you should tip around 20% or $5, depending on whichever is greater. 8. Coffee Shops This is a tough one because it depends on whether a tip is included on a screen or, in the case of a Starbucks, in a jar sitting at the register. Ideally, experts recommend as much as 15% of the cost of your coffee or latte. Even sticking a dollar in the jar is a welcome gesture. 7. Car Valet If you need a valet for your car at a shopping mall, restaurant, or airport, tipping in this space is expected. Ideally, experts say you should plan to do between $2 and $5 when your car is returned. 6. Babysitter While babysitters might make an agreed-upon hourly wage that varies based on the age of the child and the number of children, tips are not uncommon. Parents who want to keep a babysitter returning regularly should focus on rounding up any totals to try and add a little more to the balance to show appreciation. 5. Tour Guide This is a challenging one because it really depends on how much work the tour guide puts into the tour. A full-day tour? This should have a larger tip than someone who spends an hour working with you. Still, figure between 10 and 20% of the cost. 4. Bar Tabs Generally speaking, if you tip a bartender after closing out a bar tab or even just paying for one drink, think anywhere between 15% and 20% of the total. 3. Spa Services Another important tipping location is for spa service providers, who have long depended on tips as part of their wages. In these cases, experts tend to agree that 20% of the total cost of the spa day is appropriate. 2. Group Dining This is a tough one, as not every restaurant includes a separate check. However, whether you pay as a group with cash or get checks individually, the tip should reflect the same percentage. In other words, it should be roughly 20% of your portion of the bill. 1. Restaurant Tipping In one of the few business types where tipping is not only okay but expected, the same general longstanding amount rules continue to apply. On average, it’s recommended to tip between 18% and 20% of the total bill (including tax). So a $100 restaurant check would require a $20 tip or more, depending on the level of service.

The Dow is spiraling by 500 points and is being pressured by retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT), whose earnings results confirmed tariff-related fears. Among the few technology gainers are Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) as of early trading. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is among the rare gainers in the Dow today. Walmart warned that its profit growth is expected to slow down amid the company’s vulnerability to the likely Mexico and Canada tariffs. Walmart’s stock is down over 6% despite beating consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q4 as Wall Street focuses on an uncertain future. Nevertheless, TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance that Walmart is “hitting on all cylinders” for now, pointing to a resilient consumer that continues to drive revenue. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 502.74 (-1.13) Nasdaq Composite: -165.58 (-0.80%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.26 (-0.72%) Key Points The Dow Jones Industrial Average is spiraling by 500 points. Alibaba shares are soaring after a blowout quarterly earnings report. Big Tech stocks are mixed. Palantir is sinking on fears of U.S. defense budget cuts. Market Movers Alibaba is boosting tech sentiment today, rising 11.7% on the heels of its fiscal Q3 earnings report, which executives attributed “robust” AI momentum . The company’s results were driven by cloud technology as well as AI-product revenue, both of which have been soaring. Alibaba is also receiving tailwind’s from China’s competitive AI investments, including DeepSeek, as a result of which BABA stock has skyrocketed 50% so far in 2025. Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is giving up some of its recent gains, falling below the psychologically sensitive $100 level today amid a 13% drop in the stock. The Trump Administration is defense budget cuts, the industry for which Palantir creates AI-powered software solutions. Toy company Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) is among the winners in today’s session, gaining 11% on the heels of a quarterly earnings and revenue beat. Hasbro has also launched a new line of PLAY-DOH Barbie dolls in a licensing partnership with Mattel that is set to hit the store shelves at Target (NYSE: TGT). Apple shares are posting fractional gains a day after introducing the lower-priced iPhone 16. Citi analysts expect this model will represent 10% of the company’s units sold in 2025.

(NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates has increased by $9 billion so far this year to $168 billion. That makes him the eighth-wealthiest person in the world. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) He will not top any billionaire lists again. Several people are too far ahead of him, including Elon Musk. His net worth is nearly $450 billion, and he has topped the billionaire list for several months. Gates was the richest man in the world from 1995 to 2017 (except for 2008). Gates was chief executive officer of Microsoft from 1975 to 2000. He left primarily to pursue his philanthropic interests. He and his ex-wife started their foundation, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, in 2000. As of 2023, the foundation had given away $78 billion, primarily to environmental causes and gender inequality. Unlike many of the richest people in the world, Gates’s wealth is spread across many investments. His 1.3% ownership of Microsoft is worth about $60 billion. He has followed the example of his close friend Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Gates’s diversification runs across many public companies, including Buffett’s. He also owns stock in Walmart and FedEx. Gates also has tens of billions of dollars in Cascade Investment, which holds his stake in private companies, ranging from Ritz Carlton to nuclear energy startup TerraPower. He and his wife, Melinda French Gates, divorced in 2021. It is rumored that Melinda received $76 billion.

Today, it has over 10,000 locations worldwide and employs 2.1 million people. It is the largest employer in the United States, with 1.2 million workers.

Key Points While Costco might be the most popular bulk shopping location, it’s not the only one. Sam’s Club and BJ’s are both looking to steal Costco’s market share. Walmart and Target also have great deals on bulk items, especially online. Also: Discover “The Next NVIDIA” When you think about Costco, you think about electronics, televisions, samples, bulk toilet paper, bulk vitamins, and more. For most people, buying in bulk is all about saving, but the reality is that this feeling isn’t something you can only find at Costco but at numerous other retailers as well. 10. Albertsons Locations: 2,271 Known for: Locally grown produce, specialty meats, fresh fish, lots of cheese Best things to buy: The Albertson’s selection of cheese is second to none The Cheese Superstore Known for its large assortment of cheeses, Albertsons offers any number of bulk shopping items. Its selection doesn’t quite match Costco’s, but its prices sure do, and with a higher quality standard as well. Among its bulk specialties, Albertson’s excels with a meat and seafood selection, frozen foods, baby care, personal care, and cleaning and home products. Of course, don’t forget all the bulk cookies and snacks you hope to buy in one purchase. 9. Staples Locations: 994 Known for: Being a one-stop shop for office products Best things to buy: Office products, printers, chairs, computers The Office Superstore If you’re looking for an office superstore where you can bulk buy everything from staplers to printer paper, you can find it all at Staples. While Costco isn’t an office supply store, it does have the most common items you would find that Staples carries for far less. Staples is the best place for writing supplies, office basics, folders &amp; filing, desk organizers, and many storage and organization items. 8. AllBulkFoods Locations: 0 Known for: Buying everything in bulk, being online only Best things to buy: Baking, cooking products, candy, chocolate, nuts, organic snacks Dedicated Bulk Seller Relatively unknown to other names, AllBulkFoods is one of the best destinations for bulk everything. The company is proud to sell products by the “inner-pack, case, pallet, and a truckload” if that’s what everyone would like. The company makes a big sticking point that it’s an ideal shopping solution for weddings, family gatherings, holiday get-togethers, or just having friends who love to shop and enjoy a ton of bulk candy. 7. Amazon Locations: 0 Known for: A one-stop shop for everything in your life across any variety of products Best things to buy: Bulk everything like toilet paper, plasticware, food The Online Giant While it doesn’t have a physical presence with its bulk items, it’s hard to ignore just how many items you can buy in bulk on Amazon. When it comes to something like toilet paper, the sheer selection of bulk options you have is incredible. Do you need 90 or 108 toilet paper rolls in a single order? How about 360 plastic spoons? You can grab those on Amazon, too, with two-day delivery at a price that’s less than Costco. 6. Dollar Tree Locations: 15,288 Known for: Being an inexpensive variety discount store that operates in 48 states and Canada Best things to buy: Frozen foods, milk, eggs, pizza, ice cream One Dollar Goodness Dollar Tree is one of the best-known dollar stores in the country, famous for its variety of products. You can find almost anything at Dollar Tree, from private-label brands to food, dinnerware, glassware, snacks, party decorations, and more. This store is unique because you aren’t necessarily buying bulk items, but you can buy in bulk and spend less than you would at a store like Costco. 5. Winco Locations: 138 Known for: Being privately owned by employees as a no-frills warehouse-style Best things to buy: Groceries, bulk food Bulk Food Grocery The least-known name on this list, Winco Foods, is famous for being a bulk food destination. The family-style employee-owned grocery store offers a giant selection of bulk food items that would impress even the most die-hard Costco customer. Best of all, Winco has some of the best prices on dry and canned goods you can’t find anywhere else. Winco hopes to continue expanding into other markets so it can bring its bulk shopping selection to other states. 4. Target Locations: 1,956 Known for: Quality clothing, big electronics section, household goods, bedding, kitchen Best things to buy: Groceries, kids clothing, bulk items like toilet paper Bulky Bullseye Like Walmart, you might not think of Target in the same light as Costco for bulk purchases, but Target wants you to believe otherwise. This is especially true for bulk items in the household essentials category. Target is full of bulk laundry care products, Clorox wipes, trash bags, and more rolls of bulk toilet paper than you ever truly need to purchase at once. You can save 5% on every Target RedCard purchase, and no membership fee is required. 3. Walmart Locations: 10,586 Known for: Low-priced shopping, being a one-stop shop for everything in your life Best things to buy: Groceries, clothes, electronics, healthcare, medicine Big Bulk Section It’s okay if you don’t think of Walmart as a big bulk store similar to Costco, but Walmart is here to prove you wrong. Walmart’s website has an entire section dedicated to its bulk items, including hundreds of food items with significantly larger packaging that you would otherwise normally buy at Walmart. This includes bulk granola bars, pasta, rice, snacks, candy, chicken, chocolate, and more. 2. BJ’s Locations: 266 Known for: Saving up to 25% on groceries compared to traditional supermarket Best things to buy: Home decor, toys, electronics, groceries The Wholesale Club Touting the idea that you can save up to 25% on groceries compared to a traditional grocer, BJ’s makes a compelling argument over Costco. Better yet, you have the Wellsley Farms and Berkely Jensen brands, which not only rival Costco’s beloved Kirkland brand but, in many ways, beat it on price. Fill your cart with bulk deals at BJ’s and then use ExpressPay to scan products through a mobile pay and skip the checkout line. 1. Sam’s Club Locations: 599 Known for: Bulk items, low prices, no-frills shopping Best things to buy: Groceries, electronics, toilet paper, paper towels, medicine The “Other” Costco Walmart’s “Other” Location Widely considered Costco’s biggest competitor, Sam’s Club is widely known for its outstanding prices and benefits. Not only does Sam’s Club generally have a less expensive membership cost, but members of both clubs often rave about Sam’s Club discounts on beef, chicken, and alcohol, as well as having some name brands that Costco doesn’t offer in favor of its Kirkland branding.

Other retailers go out of their way to drop pricing below that of Walmart. Some of the best pricing can be found at regional grocers. Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold Forever When it comes to value pricing in the retail segment in the United States, there is a consistent belief that Walmart offers the best bang for your buck. While Amazon has certainly made a dent in Walmart with online sales, as far as physical stores go, the belief that Walmart is the least expensive isn’t always true. In many cases, other retail chains that compete with Walmart look at its pricing as the line in the sand. Said differently, plenty of competitors shop at Walmart and then determine in what categories they can beat Walmart’s pricing to attract customers to their stores. 8. Market Basket More In Your Basket Market Basket offers a lot of value for its customer base. Locations: 90 Known for: Being one of the least expensive groceries in the New England area with a “more for your dollar” slogan Best things to buy: New England fish items like clams, fresh seafood, maple syrup, pears, apples More In Your Basket There is something special about Market Basket pricing. According to a recent study, Market Basket’s pricing was 18% lower than other Boston-area groceries. This study found that a family spending $250 per week on groceries could save as much as $2,300 annually by shopping at Market Basket. The privately owned business heavily focuses on keeping prices down, which has helped Market Basket earn a reputation as one of the cheapest groceries in the US. 7. Food 4 Less Food 4 Less is more than living up to its name. Locations: 101 Known for: A no-frills grocery store where customers bag their groceries Best things to buy: Organic orange juice, cage-free brown eggs, vegetable chips, and organic creamy peanut butter A Kroger Brand Food 4 Less is backed by its parent company, Kroger. Located in just four states, the Kroger-owned Food 4 Less brand is quickly becoming a go-to choice for customers looking for inexpensive groceries. These locations sell dry goods, canned goods, baking supplies, and organic and non-organic produce for less. The same can be said for health and beauty items, though Walmart has a larger selection overall. 6. H-E-B H-E-B is a bonafide Texas staple. Locations: 420 Known for: Being region-specific to just Texas, with 380 stores in Texas and another few dozen in Mexico Best things to buy: Whataburger sauces, Texas-branded products, Taste of San Antonio, fajitas, tortillas, and more Better In Texas H-E-B offers food items you can’t find at your local Walmart. As Texans believe everything is better in Texas, this might be true if you shop at a H-E-B grocery store. Considered one of the best privately owned groceries in the country, H-E-B pricing compares very well to Walmart while offering things you can’t get at any Walmart location. However, where H-E-B truly wins is its low-priced yet outstanding quality meats and produce, which Walmart cannot match. 5. Lidl Lidl is attempting to enter the US market. Locations: 173 Known for: Fantastic selection of low-price items, including store-branded items, which account for 80% of the store’s inventory Best things to buy: Seafood and dairy, organic meats, organic fruits and vegetables, dairy products and fair-trade chocolates Store Branded Everything With its competitive pricing, Lidl will grow quickly in the US. Another international brand trying to carve out a niche in the United States, Lidl, is already well on its way to success. With 173 stores and growing, where Lidl beats out Walmart is the idea that over 80% of the items in Lidl stores are store-branded items. This means they are cheaper than brand-name items and even cheaper than Walmart’s private-label brands. Ultimately, Lidl is cheaper and healthier with grass-fed meats, organic fruits and vegetables, and organic dairy products. 4. WinCo Foods WinCo Foods is a surprisingly delightful place to shop due to its pricing. Locations: 141 Known for: Midwest-based employee-owned grocery store with more than 20,000 employees Best things to buy: Boxed foods, dairy products, and bulk chases are said to save customers a lot of money The Midwest Surprise You won’t be disappointed with the price when you enter WinCo Foods. With only 141 employee-owned locations in the Midwest, many Americans can’t walk into a WinCo Foods store. However, for those who can, the bulk purchase area in its stores can be vastly cheaper than Walmart. Everything from Arizona Iced Tea, soft drinks, eggs, spices, smoked and grilled items, and barbecue charcoal is cheaper than Walmart. This is a testament to the employee-owned nature of WinCo Foods, as they are focused on inexpensive pricing and not driving big profits. 3. Costco Shopping at Costco offers a unique experience compared to Walmart. Locations: 890 Known for: Bulk purchases, exclusive items under the Kirkland brand, regional inventory Best things to buy: Frozen foods, lunch items, fresh food, baking and cooking essentials Buying In Bulk Buying in bulk at Costco can be much less expensive than at Walmart. Costco’s pricing can be better than Walmart’s in multiple categories if you like to stock up on items simultaneously. It’s widely considered cheaper to purchase fresh food and frozen foods, and even some staples like milk and eggs can be less expensive at Costco. However, when you buy in bulk, Costco shines. Even though you will pay more upfront, you’ll restock less, which makes things like paper towels and toilet paper less expensive than Walmart. 2. Aldi Aldi beats Walmart in price in multiple categories, such as daily food staples. Locations: 2,443 Known for: No-frills shopping experience with numerous private-label products Best things to buy: German foods, baking ingredients, basic food staples, pre-cooked frozen foods The German Giant Aldi offers a no-frills grocery shopping experience. Aldi is expected to have close to 3,200 locations by 2028, making it a formidable competitor to Walmart’s grocery business. Compared to Walmart, there is an expectation you should be able to walk out of Aldi for at least a few dollars less than you would spend at Walmart if you took a list of the same items. Fans of the brand love it for basic food staples like milk and eggs, as well as foreign food items you can’t get at Walmart. 1. Target Target’s house brands are competitively priced compared to Walmart. Locations: 1,963 Known for: High-quality, low-priced items across food, clothing, beauty, and more Best things to buy: Up &amp; Up cleaning products, dealworthy essentials Walmart’s Biggest Competitor Target is consistently looking to beat Walmart’s pricing. When you think of Walmart and competition, it goes without saying that Target is at the very top of the competition. While Walmart is generally considered the less expensive of the two, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of items where Target beats Walmart, including bottled water and house-branded cleaning supplies. In many cases, Target’s Cat &amp; Jack brand also offers better pricing for kids’ clothing.
