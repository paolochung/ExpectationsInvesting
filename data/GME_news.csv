Great Expectations 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo A cautious tone persists in today&#8217;s trading, with the three major stock market averages slightly in the red. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) shares are up 0.33% ahead of its highly anticipated quarterly earnings report expected after the closing bell. The prevailing sentiment is that Nvidia will once again exceed expectations and upgrade its guidance due to strong AI and chip demand. Yet, concerns linger regarding a potential write-down linked to China revenues, even with overall strong demand. The SPY ETF is lower by 0.16%. Consumer Spending on Deck 10:49 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive greater insight on the resilience of the consumer this week. Personal Income and Spending data for April is due out on Friday. This data follows a period of robust consumer spending observed in March. Economists at Wells Fargo anticipate a 0.3% increase in personal income and a 0.2% rise in personal spending. SPY is currently lower by 0.24%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets are treading carefully today, following yesterday&#8217;s powerful surge driven by news of EU import tariff delays. The spotlight is now firmly on corporate earnings, particularly those of chip giant Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), whose highly anticipated quarterly results are due after the market closes. Early morning trading shows stocks with minimal direction, as the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all registering modest gains. The SPY ETF is down 0.11% as of mid-morning trading. Here&#8217;s a look at the SPY over the past five trading sessions: The &#8220;Magnificent Seven&#8221; stocks are largely flat, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) up 1% and the rest of the cohort seeing mixed trading. GameStop (NYSE: GME) has dipped 3.5% today after venturing into the cryptocurrency space with its initial bitcoin acquisition exceeding $500 million, mirroring moves by MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has offloaded some TSLA shares while increasing its stake in Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings announcement. Elon Musk attempted to soothe investor concerns by posting about his relentless work schedule. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 22.97 (-0.05%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 9.71 (-0.05%) S&amp;P 500: Down 2.27 (-0.04%) Market Movers Retailer Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) is down 2.7% today, having cut its profit outlook amidst tariff-related challenges and cautious consumer sentiment. Conversely, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) is surging by 25.9% after easily beating its first-quarter earnings estimates. Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY), an electric air taxi firm, has climbed 26% following a $250 million strategic investment from automaker Toyota Motor. After initially rising above $127 per share, identity management company Okta (Nasdaq: OKTA) is now down 12% in the wake of its quarterly results, experiencing profit-taking. Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE: FICO) is recovering recent losses and is up 6.8% today.

Biotech Benefits from Generative AI 2:02 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Jefferies believes certain biotechnology stocks are poised to benefit from AI advancements. Analyst Michael Yee told CNBC that the sector is likely to save billions of dollars as well as time in getting drugs to market thanks to the role of generative AI in drug discovery. The firm is bullish on biotech stocks for the rest of 2025, saying any bad news is already built into the sector. The Nasdaq Composite is basically flat ahead of Nvidia&#8217;s earnings. Market Update 12:33 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks are continuing to play it safe in today&#8217;s trading session, with the three major stock market averages fractionally lower across the board. VP JD Vance is headlining today&#8217;s Bitcoin 2025 event, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift the BTC price, which is up about 0.17%. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock is up 0.33% today ahead of its quarterly earnings report due out this afternoon. The markets have come to expect Nvidia beating expectations and raising its guidance on strong AI and chip demand. Demand has been strong, but one area of concern is a write-down tied to China revenues. The Nasdaq Composite is currently down 0.09%. Personal Income &amp; Spending Preview 10:38 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive another dose of economic data on Friday when the Personal Income and Spending report for the month of April is released. The report will come on the heels of strong consumer spending in March. Wells Fargo economists forecast personal income growth of 0.3% and personal spending to rise 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.18%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are playing it cautious following yesterday&#8217;s strong rally fueled by EU import tariff delays. Today all eyes are on corporate America, more specifically semiconductor leader Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), which reports its highly anticipated quarterly results after the closing bell. Stocks are showing little conviction in early morning trading, with the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posting fractional gains. The Magnificent Seven stocks are little changed, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) posting a 1% gain and the rest of the group trading mixed. GameStop (NYSE: GME) is down 3.5% on the day after expanding its footprint into the cryptocurrency markets with its maiden bitcoin purchase worth over $500 million, taking a page from the books of MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has unloaded some TSLA shares while buying more Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings report. Elon Musk attempted to reassure investors by posting that he is working around the clock. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 54.20 (+0.13%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 43.57 (+0.23%) S&amp;P 500: Up 9.99 (+0.17%) Market Movers Retailer Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) is down 2.7% today after slashing its profit forecast amid tariff-related headwinds and consumer skittishness. On the flip side, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) is soaring by 25.9% after handily surpassing Q1 earnings estimates. Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY), an electric air taxi company, is up 26% after receiving a $250 million strategic investment from automaker Toyota Motor. After the stock initially climbed above $127 per share, Identity management company Okta (Nasdaq: OKTA) is experiencing a 12% decline on the heels of its quarterly results amid profit taking.

GME,2025-05-19 10:00:04,Michael Burry Predicted The Housing Market Crash and Just Sold His Portfolio and Shorted The Market Again,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/michael-burry-predicted-the-housing-market-crash-and-just-20250519.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Michael Burry is a hedge fund manager renowned for founding Scion Capital and predicting the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. His foresight, detailed in Michael Lewis’s The Big Short, which was made into an Oscar-winning film, earned him $100 million personally and $700 million for investors by shorting mortgage-backed securities. Burry’s contrarian approach, rooted in meticulous research and value investing inspired by Benjamin Graham, also sparked the GameStop (NYSE:GME) meme stock frenzy in 2021 through early investments. Known for spotting market bubbles, he has warned of risks in passive investing and inflation. His renamed Scion Asset Management hedge fund just filed its latest quarterly report, and Burry made headlines again because he sold 12 of the 13 stocks in his $77.4 million portfolio, including stakes in Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH). More to the point, Burry is once again aggressively shorting the market. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Michael Burry runs the Scion Asset Management hedge fund who gained fame for shorting the housing market during the subprime mortgage debacle in 2008. Burry made a number of big bets on Chinese tech stocks that he started turning bearish on late last year. In Scion&#8217;s latest SEC filing, it showed Burry went extremely negative by selling off virtually all of his stocks and buying put options on many of them. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. Going Negative Burry&#8217;s portfolio is typically fairly concentrated. Where many hedge funds hold dozens, if not hundreds of stocks, Scion Asset held just a baker&#8217;s dozen. In addition to Alibaba and Molina, Burry also owned several large positions in Chinese stocks, including e-commerce site JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), search engine giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), the owner of online shopping platforms Temu and Pinduoduo. The sale of these companies suggests Burry had become more bearish, but not necessarily on the U.S. market. Rather, it is on China&#8217;s economy that his outlook became more pessimistic. He actually began selling down most of his Chinese holdings late last year, but he didn&#8217;t move to a cash position. Instead, he began betting heavily against them by buying put options on the stocks, also betting Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM), a Chinese online travel agent, would go down as well. A Bet Against Tech There was one U.S. company that Burry went negative on as well: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). In fact, the put options he holds on the artificial intelligence chipmaker are the largest position in Scion&#8217;s portfolio now, valued at over $97.5 million and accounting for 49% of the portfolio. Alibaba is the next closest position with a $26.4 million value, or 13% of the total. A put option is a financial contract giving the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset (in this case, the stock) at a specified price called the strike price before or on a set expiration date. Investors use puts to hedge against price declines or speculate on falling markets. If the asset’s price drops below the strike price, the buyer can sell at the higher strike, profiting from the difference. If the price rises, the buyer may let the option expire, losing only the premium paid. Puts are key tools for managing risk or betting on bearish trends. Delayed Reaction Because 13F-HR filings &#8212; the equivalent of a quarterly report for institutional investment managers &#8212; are looking in the rearview mirror, they only tell us what happened in the past. In Scion Asset Management&#8217;s case, it reflects its first quarter activity. All of these trades could have occurred in early January, and despite only just filing the report, Burry&#8217;s portfolio could look markedly different today. For example, Alibaba&#8217;s stock tumbled sharply in March and early April, before bouncing higher again. BABA stock is up 47% so far in 2025. Both JD.com and Baidu followed a similar pattern, though not to the same degree. JD stock is down 3% year-to-date while BIDU is up 6%. Although the Chinese stocks rallied early in the year due to the DeepSeek AI breakthrough development, its purported low-cost challenge to large language models caused Nvidia to plunge. Nvidia suffered the steepest decline, falling as low as $86 a share, or 30% below where it started the year, before rebounding. It is essentially flat in 2025, having surged 55% from its low point. Burry may have sold all of his put options on these stocks when their prices were below the strike price. Key Takeaway It&#8217;s interesting that Burry sold all the stocks in his portfolio, except one. The hedge fund operator held onto his position in cosmetics giant Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL), and actually doubled his stake in its stock, buying another 100,000 shares for a total value of $13.2 million. Yet Burry bet so heavily against the Chinese stocks that EL now represents less than 7% of Scion Asset Management&#8217;s holdings, whereas before it represented nearly 10%. This is not the same as Burry&#8217;s Big Short bet 17 years ago that brought him fame and fortune, but his moves last quarter were notable because of their obvious negative implications for China.

GME,2025-03-27 11:39:55,Here’s What’s Driving Bitcoin’s March Higher,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/heres-whats-driving-bitcoins-march-higher-20250327.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"The bitcoin price is little changed at last check and is down 1.2% over the past 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency is up just over 3% in the past seven-day stretch but a better 10%-plus since its March bottom in the ballpark of $76,000. Investors might need to look at the BTC price through a slightly wider lens to appreciate its march higher this month. Meanwhile, bitcoin rival &#8211; precious metal gold &#8211; continues to hit new all-time highs above the $3,000 per ounce threshold. Gold is acting like the portfolio diversifier and inflationary hedge that it was designed to be. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been more sensitive to the same market headwinds that are haunting stocks, including inflation, tariff uncertainty and worries of an economic recession. The bitcoin price remains 20% below its all-time high reached in early 2025 of just over $109,000 per BTC. Key Points The bitcoin price is little changed at the moment and has fallen 1.2% in the past 24 hours. The very same headwinds that are holding back the stock market appear to be limiting BTC to its current range. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. Bitcoin Catalysts While bitcoin has its own monetary policy, including a supply limit of 21 million coins, the biggest crypto can still be swayed by what is going on with central banks. For example, BlackRock&#8217;s digital asset head Robert Mitchnick reportedly believes an economic recession in the U.S. would be a positive catalyst for the bitcoin price. If a recession were to rear its head, the Federal Reserve would likely pivot to more dovish monetary policy on interest rates. Video game retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME) reportedly has plans to add bitcoin to its balance sheet, taking a page out of the books of early movers like Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR). GameStop, the stock that was at the center of the WallStreetBets-fueled rally in 2021, plans to direct its cash flow toward acquiring bitcoins in the hopes of riding the cryptocurrency&#8217;s eventual rise higher. Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, whose company he founded has been adding bitcoin aggressively, welcomed GameStop Ryan Cohen to what he called &#8220;Team Bitcoin.&#8221; While all the excitement has sparked a rally in the GME stock, it has failed to lift the bitcoin price higher today. Now What? Bitcoin bulls are coming out of the woodwork on expectations that another bull cycle is up ahead for the cryptocurrency. By looking at the BTC price through a wider lens, it&#8217;s clear to see it&#8217;s having a good March despite hovering below its record high price. When the bitcoin price decides to break out further remains to be seen, but companies like GameStop and asset managers like BlackRock are betting it eventually will.The post Here&#8217;s What&#8217;s Driving Bitcoin&#8217;s March Higher appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/03/26/heres-whats-driving-bitcoins-march-higher/

So while most of the world fixates on the rollercoaster swings of A.I. stocks like Nvidia, Google and Microsoft… Luke Lango says you have to look beyond the headlines to see the real AI wealth creation story taking shape… And he claims its centered around a tiny $3 AI stock at the heart of a $100 Trillion wealth shift. It’s a startup he says could soon be “The Amazon of Real Estate.” As its proprietary AI technology revolutionizes how virtually everyone buys and sells their home, Luke believes this small startup could soon balloon to a $100 billion company. That kind of growth, Lango projects, could send the stock price soaring by as much as 1,000% in the coming year. In a brand new streaming video, Luke Lango travels straight to the Silicon Valley headquarters of this company to reveal why this could be “the biggest wealth-generation opportunity no one is talking about.” Lango says the stock’s share price is not likely to stay low for long, due to the enormous buzz it’s generating in Silicon Valley. As a Silicon Valley insider himself, Luke decided to “break ranks” and share the name, ticker and details of this company right here — no strings attached. So make sure you have a pen and paper ready to go when he reveals the ticker of his NEXT big 1,000% AI bet. Click Here to Watch the Full Story… With Innovation Investor, Luke Lango’s goal is to offer readers research on an elevated small-cap investing strategy that goes beyond anything that’s been done before on Wall Street. Luke was ranked America’s #1 stock picker in 2020 according to TipRanks and has 15 recommendations that have soared as high as 1,000% or more over his tenure. *All investing includes risk of loss*",https://investorplace.com/2023/10/no-1-ai-investment-might-be-this-company-youve-never-heard-of/
