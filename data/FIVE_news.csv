The American chain — which offers items priced between $1 and $5 — has more than 1,800 locations spanning across 45 states. Five Below and Uber Eats announced a partnership on Thursday. “Five Below is a go-to destination for fun, trendy, and affordable products — and now, customers can get their favorites delivered on-demand,” said Hashim Amin, Head of Grocery & Retail for Uber Eats North America. “Whether it’s a last-minute birthday gift, a Friday night snack haul, or just a spontaneous treat, we’re thrilled to unlock even more convenience and value through this exciting partnership.” Five Below's new online accessibility will allow fans of the shop to order ""top brand"" toys, games, candy, graphic tees, tech, crafts, room décor, beauty and more. ""No slumber party, game night, or snack run left behind,"" the company said Thursday. Uber One members will get free delivery on eligible orders. Five Below operates in the following states: Uber Eats says it is expanding its selection of retail and non-food offerings. Here's how to order Five Below products through Uber Eats: The retailer has announced it is opening 14 new locations this year in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Utah and Virigina. MORE RETAIL NEWS FROM PATCH: The shop offers brands popular with teens, including Squishmallows, Hello Kitty, L.A. Colors, Nickelodeon, Marvel, Disney, Star Wars, Hershey's and more. Five Below was born from a simple brainstorming session between two friends and business partners, Tom and David, at their local coffee shop. Fueled by caffeine and a shared entrepreneurial spirit, they sketched out a new kind of retail concept — one designed to resonate with kids and teens. That back-of-the-napkin idea became the foundation for what is now Five Below, a brand built on creativity, accessibility, and a promise to deliver fun and value from day one, according to the company. The chain has grown significantly in recent years while other ultra-low-priced competitors like Dollar General and its concept Popshelf have struggled financially, prompting scores of locations to shutter permanently across the nation. Popshelf, the chain with a youthful concept that nearly mirrors Five Below's, planned to close 45 locations in 2025, the company said in March.",https://www.patch.com/us/across-america/affordable-retailer-now-available-home-delivery

FIVE,2025-06-05 10:30:05,Five Below (FIVE) Earnings Live: Stock Strength Hinges on High Expectations,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/five-below-five-earnings-live-stock-strength-hinges-on-20250605.png,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Wall Street Roundup 6:15 pm by Joel South Here&#8217;s a roundup of the most recent analyst calls on FIVE stock prior to earnings: Earlier this month, Mizuho raised its price target on FIVE stock from $88 to $100, maintaining a Neutral rating. Barclays kept its equal weight rating with a $93 price target. Loop Capital lifted its price target from $85 to $90, maintaining a hold rating. Earnings Beat but Stock Seesaws on Guidance 4:16 pm by Joel South Five Below delivered a robust first quarter for fiscal year 2026, surpassing Wall Street&#8217;s consensus estimates for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. This performance aligns with the pre-earnings preview&#8217;s expectation of a &#8220;strong bounce-back quarter&#8221; and the &#8220;first positive comp since early FY24,&#8221; driven by renewed confidence in the company&#8217;s merchandising reset and improved consumer foot traffic. The most important quarterly numbers reveal the extent of the beat: Q1 EPS: Five Below reported an EPS of $0.86, significantly outperforming the consensus estimate of $0.66. This is a substantial beat, exceeding the preview&#8217;s projected improvement and marking a strong rebound from prior &#8220;miss&#8221; trends. Q1 Revenue: The company posted revenue of $970.5 million, comfortably beating the consensus estimate of $932.86 million. This revenue figure also tops the preview&#8217;s expectation of $966.5 million and reflects the anticipated &#8220;13% YoY revenue increase.&#8221; Same-Store Sales (Comps): While the exact comparable sales figure for Q1 was not immediately available in the earnings headlines, the strong revenue beat strongly suggests that the company achieved or exceeded the consensus estimate of +6.7% comp growth. This would confirm the preview&#8217;s emphasis on a &#8220;first material comp improvement in over a year.&#8221; Despite these strong Q1 results, Five Below&#8217;s stock initially dipped 2.4% in after-hours trading but has since recovered and is up 2.6%. This volatile reaction is likely attributable to the company&#8217;s full-year FY2026 guidance. While Q1 was impressive, the provided full-year EPS guidance of $4.25-$4.72 falls below the analyst consensus of $4.75. The FY2026 revenue guidance of $4.33-$4.42 billion was generally in line. Five Below (FIVE) Q1 FY2026 Earnings: Actuals vs. Estimates Earnings Per Share (EPS): Consensus Estimate: $0.66 Actual Result: $0.86 Revenue: Consensus Estimate: $932.86 million Actual Result: $970.5 million Same-Store Sales (Comps): Consensus Estimate: +6.7% Actual Result: While the exact figure isn&#8217;t in the initial headline, the substantial revenue beat strongly suggests actual comparable sales were at or above the +6.7% estimate. This would mark the first positive comp in over a year, as anticipated. Execution Risks 3:47 pm by Joel South Five Below’s biggest execution risk is that the Q1 bounce proves ephemeral. If the comp improvement is tied primarily to stimulus-driven spending or promotional intensity, margin leverage may not hold in the second half of the year. The company’s brand equity and merchandising cadence must remain sharp to defend recent gains. Labor cost inflation is another pressure point. As the company scales store count, any slowdown in top-line productivity would quickly pressure EBIT margins — especially if wage growth continues outpacing historical averages. Store labor is a high-leverage variable in the model. Tariffs represent a structural threat. If the U.S. enacts new China-related duties in the second half of 2025 — as some election-cycle scenarios imply — Five Below could face $30M–$50M in incremental costs. Passing those costs to consumers may not be feasible in a value-driven retail model. Lastly, real estate execution is always a variable risk for a rapid grower. With over 1,600 stores and plans for 200+ annual openings by FY27, the company must remain disciplined in site selection and ensure that new formats (e.g., Five Beyond, suburban strip) are hitting pro forma returns. A slowdown in new store productivity would challenge the bull case on scale leverage. Keys to Watch 3:15 pm by Joel South Do comp trends remain consistent into May/June, or was Q1 front-loaded? Is store-level wage pressure still manageable within FY25 margin targets? How will potential tariff escalations be offset — price, mix, or sourcing? The Street will be laser-focused on whether Five Below’s comp recovery is sticky. Management has emphasized that value-seeking consumers are returning, especially in discretionary categories like toys, tech accessories, and seasonal home. If those trends continue into Q2, it would suggest the brand is regaining pricing power and customer loyalty. Another key focus is operating expense discipline. With over 150 stores planned for FY26, questions remain about labor availability and real estate efficiency. Investors want clarity on how wage increases are being absorbed and whether new stores are generating acceptable ROI relative to historical averages. Finally, tariffs remain a wildcard. Roughly 25–30% of Five Below’s COGS is exposed to imports from China, and any resumption of Section 301 duties could erode gross margins unless pricing power is intact. Management’s tone on mitigation strategies — including SKU mix shifts and supply chain flexibility — will be critical. Consensus Snapshot 2:30 pm by Joel South Q1 EPS Estimate: $0.83 Q1 Revenue Estimate: $966.5 million Same-Store Sales (Consensus): +6.7% Historical EPS Surprises: Miss, Miss, +146% Beat, Modest Beat Gross Margin Guidance (last call): ~33%–34% Wall Street expects a strong bounce-back quarter, with 6.7% comp growth driving a ~13% YoY revenue increase. If realized, that would mark Five Below’s first positive comp since early FY24 and a significant reversal from the -2.7% full-year comp just reported. EPS is projected at $0.83, reflecting improved store productivity but tempered by wage and freight cost pressure. Consensus estimates imply a modest sequential improvement in gross margin, though still below peak pre-COVID levels. Sell-side analysts remain split: bulls argue that new merchandising strategies and a more resilient Gen Z shopper base can drive sustained traffic gains; skeptics believe current trends are more cyclical than structural and expect margin reversion by 2H FY26. With short interest modest but rising (~8.8%), a clean beat could support continued upside. Five Below (Nasdaq: FIVE) enters its Q1 FY2026 earnings report riding a powerful rebound. Shares have more than doubled from their April lows, driven by a broader rotation into consumer discretionary, better-than-expected April foot traffic data, and renewed confidence in the company’s merchandising reset. The sharp reversal follows a challenging FY2025, in which comps declined, margins compressed, and sentiment turned bearish amid macro and execution concerns. CEO Joel Anderson and the leadership team have spent the last two quarters emphasizing a return to the chain’s core strengths — high-volume, high-turn categories; rapid new store openings; and tiered value merchandising. Strategic initiatives like Five Beyond (higher-ticket items) and seasonal aisle optimizations are being pushed more aggressively. Early reads from Q1 suggest a more engaged value shopper and better inventory flow-through versus prior quarters. Still, risks remain. Five Below continues to face cost inflation on both labor and freight, and any escalation in U.S.–China tariffs could pressure FY25 margin guidance. Moreover, while the comp turnaround looks encouraging, the company will need to prove that this is a sustained trend, not a single-quarter bounce. With investor expectations now reset higher, the post-earnings reaction will be highly sensitive to tone.
