SmartAsset&#8217;s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don&#8217;t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) A seismic shift has transformed global manufacturing in recent years, with US and EU companies increasingly moving production from China to India. Accelerated by President Trump’s use of tariffs as trade weapons, this movement began a few years ago as geopolitical tensions and economic pressures began to raise concerns about supply chain resilience. India’s proactive policies have served to drive this trend toward supply chain diversification. While India has made remarkable progress over the past three decades, and holds vast potential as a manufacturing hub, infrastructure gaps and regulatory complexities present challenges. The primary driver is escalating friction with China. U.S.-China trade wars have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods, pushing companies to seek alternatives. From 2018 to 2022, U.S. goods imports from China dropped 10% (inflation-adjusted), while imports from India soared 44%, per trade data. Concerns over intellectual property theft and supply chain risks exposed during COVID-19 further fueled this shift. China’s rising labor and production costs have also eroded its edge in labor-intensive sectors like textiles and electronics, prompting companies to explore cost-competitive alternatives. India has emerged as a prime destination, propelled by initiatives like “Make in India” and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes. These offer tax breaks (e.g., a 17% corporate tax rate for new manufacturing firms), subsidies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), and a stable legal system rooted in British common law, safeguarding intellectual property. India’s youthful workforce (median age 28) and 1.4 billion-strong consumer market enhance its appeal. Apple, for example, has ramped up iPhone production in India, with Foxconn investing $1.5 billion in Tamil Nadu to supply the U.S. market. India’s share of Apple’s iPhone output grew from 2% to 5% between 2021 and 2022, with goals to hit 25%. Other giants like Dell, Nike, Intel, and Nippon Steel are also shifting production, with over 90% of North American manufacturers surveyed by BCG reporting some relocation from China in the past five years. Yet despite India’s appeal, challenges do remain. India’s infrastructure lags, with only 5% of roads classified as highways, causing logistical bottlenecks. Regulatory red tape hinders operations, with just 55% of companies reporting seamless production shifts. Manufacturing costs in India can also run 5–10% higher than in China due to import duties on components. India faces competition from Vietnam, a leader in electronics, and Mexico, advantaged by its proximity to the U.S. Companies and investors must navigate these hurdles to ensure profitability. This shift opens doors for entrepreneurs and businesses. Investors can target Indian firms or ETFs in booming sectors like electronics and semiconductors, which attracted $16 billion in manufacturing FDI from 2020 to 2023. Content creators can monetize blogs or videos on India’s manufacturing surge through ads or sponsorships. Consulting services offer another path, providing market research or regulatory guidance for firms entering India. Businesses can also develop logistics or compliance solutions to address operational challenges. The pivot from China to India reflects geopolitical, economic, and logistical realities. India’s policies and demographic strengths position it as a rising manufacturing powerhouse, but infrastructure and regulatory hurdles require careful strategy. Opportunities in investment, content creation, and consulting abound for those who can navigate India’s complexities with precision. Investors can explore top Indian companies listed on U.S. exchanges, such as HDFC Bank (NYSE: HDB), Infosys (NYSE: INFY), or MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ: MMYT). For broader exposure, the iShares MSCI India ETF (NASDAQ: INDA) tracks the MSCI India Index, covering roughly 85% of India’s large and mid-cap equity market.

DELL,2025-04-16 12:30:14,Why Do Chase Shopping Offers Feel Blah Compared to Capital One’s 100+ Deals?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/why-do-chase-shopping-offers-feel-blah-compared-to-20250416.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the world of cash-back credit cards, Chase and Capital One are undoubtedly two of the best places to start. With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it’s concerning that this isn’t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it’s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy’s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I’m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You’ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster’s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One’s layout is far easier to navigate, but it’s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn’t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache.

DELL,2025-04-04 09:30:13,Live: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) Plummets 4% as Nike (NKE) and Dell (DELL) Sink,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/live-vanguard-sp-500-etf-voo-plummets-4-as-20250404.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"A day following &#8220;Liberation Day,&#8221; the talk of the town is that investors have been liberated from capital gains taxes. The Dow Jones is down 3.72%, the Nasdaq is down more than 5%, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO) is down 3.93% as of 10:25 a.m. ET. Why is the market selling off? Tariffs announced by the Trump Administration are estimated to reduce trade by $900 billion this year. Almost every Wall Street bank is now pulling back economic growth estimates for the year. Tariff rates on other countries announced last night range from 10% to more than 50%. As of 2022, the United States had a weighted-average tariff rate of about 1.5%. However, after Trump&#8217;s tariff announcement yesterday the United States would have a weighted average tariff rate of 29%. Another issue driving stocks down today is the fact these tariffs appear to be less of a &#8216;negotiating tactic&#8217; and something that will be in place for a prolonged period of time. For example, both Vietnam and Israel announced large cuts to tariffs on U.S. goods, but saw reciprocal tariff rates of 46% and 17%, respectively. What Stocks Are Falling in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF? What stocks in the VOO are seeing the biggest declines today? Retailers and Clothing: Williams-Sonoma is down 18.1%, Deckers Outdoor down 16.9%, Ralph Lauren down 16.9%, and Nike down 13%. Each of these companies faces not only reduced consumer spending if a recession happens but also have overseas supply chains that would see significant tariff impacts if these tariffs take effect as presented on April 9th. Consumer Electronics: Dell is down 15.3%, HP is down 15.7%, and Best Buy is down 15.8%. Once again, these companies not only face reduced consumer demand but significant tariffs on their products. Apple was down 9% in early trading but has trimmed its losses to 7.9%.

DELL,2025-04-02 11:04:39,New AI benchmarks test speed of running AI applications,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/new-ai-benchmarks-test-speed-of-running-ai-applications-20250402.jpg,https://www.marketscreener.com,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence group MLCommons unveiled two new benchmarks that it said can help determine how quickly top-of-the-line hardware and software can run AI applications. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT over two years ago, chip companies have begun to shift their focus to making hardware that can efficiently run the code that allows millions of people to use AI tools. As the underlying models must respond to many more queries to power AI applications such as chatbots and search engines, MLCommons developed two new versions of its MLPerf benchmarks to gauge speed. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); One of the new benchmarks is based on Meta's so-called Llama 3.1 405-billion-parameter AI model, and the test targets general question answering, math and code generation. The new format tests a system's ability to process large queries and synthesize data from multiple sources. Nvidia submitted several of its chips for the benchmark, and so did system builders such as Dell Technologies. There were no Advanced Micro Devices submissions for the large 405-billion-parameter benchmark, according to data provided by MLCommons. For the new test, Nvidia's latest generation of artificial intelligence servers - called Grace Blackwell, which have 72 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) inside - was 2.8 to 3.4 times faster than the previous generation, even when only using eight GPUs in the newer server to create a direct comparison to the older model, the company said at a briefing on Tuesday. Nvidia has been working to speed up the connections of chips inside its servers, which is important in AI work where a chatbot runs on multiple chips at once. The second benchmark is also based on an open-source AI model built by Meta and the test aims to more closely simulate the performance expectations set by consumer AI applications such as ChatGPT. The goal is to tighten the response time for the benchmark and make it close to an instant response. (Reporting by Max A.

DELL,2024-11-28 03:37:38,These 5 Imports Are Causing 27% of America’s Trade Deficit,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-5-imports-are-causing-27-of-americas-trade-20241128.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"24/7 Insights Trade deficits aren’t necessarily a bad thing, and a little education can help us make better decisions regarding our trade policies. The responsibility for reducing our trade deficit rests on companies and politicians, not the end consumer. Download our free report on the two stocks we recommend every investor buy. The United States’ trade deficit, along with our public debt, makes headlines every election cycle, with all sides complaining about it but stopping short of actually implementing any real solutions. But which products actually drive the high deficit of our trade? Is there anything we can do to shrink the deficit, and do we even want to? Here are the top five imports that account for 27.5%, almost one-third, of our trade deficit. For this list, we consulted the data published by the United States Census Bureau in November of 2024, titled U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES, SEPTEMBER 2024. This data is current as of September 2024. Background on the U.S. Balance of Trade An image depicting international trade, most of which takes place through container ships. In order to understand the balance of trade for the United States, it is important to clear up some misconceptions, and fear, surrounding a trade deficit. Too often, elected officials spread fear and anger about the trade deficit without fully understanding how it works themselves, or why they are worried about it themselves. If they do understand but continue to spread misinformation and fear, then we should take a good, hard look at why they are in office. To begin, a trade deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports. A country with a high population with large amounts of discretionary income will always consume more than it produces. This trade deficit is usually accompanied by (but not necessarily tied to or causal with) public debt. When a country begins to export more goods than it imports, known as a trade surplus, the trade deficit will shrink. The United States had its last trade surplus in 1975 and has maintained a trade deficit ever since. Here are things to know about trade deficits. First, a trade deficit isn’t necessarily bad. The idea that trade deficits should be avoided or eliminated is rejected by all economists and trade experts. Trade deficits in the United States usually only increase when the U.S. economy is growing because American citizens are able to buy more things that they want which are produced abroad, rather than living paycheck to paycheck and only paying for necessities that are produced at home. Second, American companies usually exacerbate the problem of trade deficits and make them worse by taking advantage of recessions and economic hardship by transferring manufacturing and programming jobs to cheaper labor overseas and replacing them with low-paying service jobs here in the United States. Third, it isn’t your job to fix the deficit. Consumers will buy the best product that fits their needs and their budget. If that product happens to be imported from a foreign country, it doesn’t matter to them. Their families need to eat, they need cars to travel, they need clothes to wear, and books to learn. Asking American consumers to buy a more expensive alternative simply because it is produced domestically, even though they can barely afford the imported version, is putting the responsibility on the end user to fix the situation instead of those who created the problem in the first place: corporations and politicians. Fourth, countries export services as well as goods. In the case of the United States, however, the goods we import far outweigh the services we import, and sometimes we have a trade surplus for services. Fifth, many of the goods we import, including some on this list, are from companies that are based within the United States already. These companies produce or manufacture goods for pennies overseas before importing them to the United States to be sold for high premiums. Everything from clothing to Apple computers, and medicine to smartphones. High tariffs, aggressive foreign policies, and other antagonistic behavior toward our trade partners will do nothing but make this problem worse. #5 Computers A photo of the Apple logo. Imports in 2024: $89,137 million It should be no surprise that computers are on this list, since most computers of all prices and capabilities are produced outside the United States, and those that are produced domestically are usually outperformed in both quality and capabilities by foreign competitors. This category includes everything for desktop computers, tablets, laptops, and other specialty computers. Most of the products in this category come from China, with Mexico in a close second. #5 Computers (Cont.) Most companies prefer to produce their computers in foreign countries that take advantage of cheap (often exploitative) labor but keep their headquarters or offices within the United States to take advantage of tax incentives and high-skill talent. The top companies importing computers include Apple, Dell, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Samsung, Toshiba, ASUS, and more. #4 Other Automotive Parts and Accessories A mechanic inspecting a car thermostat. Imports in 2024: $110,071 million This import category is different from engines and engine parts which has its own category. This would be everything outside of the engine but still needed for the car to operate properly or be allowed to be sold in the United States. #4 Other Automotive Parts and Accessories (Cont.) This covers everything from parts that are added by the auto company after the vehicle is completed but before it is sent to customers or dealers, replacement parts, special parts and features offered by the company, and more. Given the astronomical cost of insurance and cars in general and the ridiculous number of cars in the United States, it makes sense that car parts would be on this list. #3 Crude Oil An oil drill rig and pump jack in the Rechitsa region of Belarus. Imports in 2024: $126,560 million America loves oil. Besides our addiction to cars and driving, oil is used for dozens of other things we consume on a daily basis. The United States, like other countries, imports crude oil and refines it in domestic refineries into things like gasoline, diesel, synthetic rubber, asphalt, lubricants, plastic, refrigerants, paint, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, fertilizer, and other things. The position of crude oil on this list can fluctuate wildly depending on the time of year, the global supply of crude oil, and international politics. #3 Crude Oil (Cont.) For better or worse, it is safe to say that America as we know it would cease to exist without the import of crude oil. The peak of crude oil production is expected to happen in or before 2035 when climate change mitigation policies and renewable energy will finally begin (hopefully) to reach mass adoption. #2 Passenger Cars Most cars sit in lots like this for months while they wait to be sold. Imports in 2024: $162,140 million Of the five imports on this list, three of them are related directly to America’s absolute, all-powerful obsession with cars and driving. We had car parts, then crude oil, and now passenger cars themselves. When you look at the culture of America in general, this should come as no surprise. #2 Passenger Cars (Cont.) We need cars to work, visit family, buy groceries, participate in our public services and responsibilities, and more. We even need cars to go buy more cars. Many families have more than two or three vehicles each. We have autoplexes and dealerships, drive-in theaters, car washes, auto repair shops, car detail shops, racetracks, multi-level parking garages, thousands of miles of roads in every city, parking lots that stretch for miles, and gas stations at almost every intersection. Garages come standard with every home. We love our cars. #1 Pharmaceutical Preparations A man looking through medicines, most of which was produced overseas. Imports in 2024: $178,440 million This category includes the final pharmaceutical itself, as well as the ingredients or components that will be combined to create the final pharmaceutical product. Given the astronomical price of healthcare and medicine in the United States, it makes sense that pharmaceuticals will be near the top of the list. The American healthcare system incentivizes large healthcare companies to produce and manufacture medicines for extremely low prices in foreign countries before importing them to be sold at huge markups in domestic markets. 100 Million Americans Are Missing This Crucial Retirement Tool The thought of burdening your family with a financial disaster is most Americans’ nightmare. However, recent studies show that over 100 million Americans still don’t have proper life insurance in the event they pass away. Life insurance can bring peace of mind – ensuring your loved ones are safeguarded against unforeseen expenses and debts. With premiums often lower than expected and a variety of plans tailored to different life stages and health conditions, securing a policy is more accessible than ever. A quick, no-obligation quote can provide valuable insight into what’s available and what might best suit your family’s needs. Life insurance is a simple step you can take today to help secure peace of mind for your loved ones tomorrow.

Results include six rock samples grading greater than 10 g/t gold and eight soil samples grading greater than 2 g/t gold — confirming a 400-metre extension to the high-grade gold zone at Muddy Creek. “Our 2024 field crews added considerable size to the high-grade gold zone identified at Muddy Creek,” Nova head of exploration Hans Hoffman said. “With the continued discovery of these high-grade gold-bearing quartz-arsenopyrite veins over an 800-metre strike length, Muddy Creek has elevated itself as a viable drill target, and certainly one of the best geochemical anomalies on the claim block.” Investors have reacted positively to the results with NVA shares trading 11.36% higher in opening ASX trade to A$0.245. Nova’s 2024 surface reconnaissance program consisted of 14 rock samples, with a high of 128.5 g/t gold, and 11 soil samples, with a high of 6.3 g/t gold. Nova explains that the results, as summarised below, continue to show Muddy Creek to be one of the most impressive gold anomalies on the claim block with these results extending the high-grade zone by approximately 400 meters. The best 2024 surface sampling results at Muddy Creek include: Four rock samples greater than 20 g/t gold - Five soil samples greater than 3 g/t gold - Previously announced results from Muddy Creek, from 2023, included six samples greater than 50 g/t gold - 127.5 g/t, 90.5 g/t, 76.8 g/t, 75.5 g/t, 65.6 g/t and 51.8 g/t gold.

A $30 million research and development facility will support exploration, appraisal and development activities, including drilling C5H and construction of infield infrastructure, via an upsize and maturity extension of an existing $2.25 million facility. An additional $5 million performance bond facility will meet Empire’s Northern Territory environmental bonding obligations and a further $30 million midstream infrastructure facility will finance refurbishment and construction of the Carpentaria Gas Plant and associated infrastructure. “The financing package with Macquarie announced today followed an extensive competitive tender process and provides Empire with the best terms currently available in the debt market,” Empire Energy managing director Alex Underwood said. “Macquarie has been financing Empire Energy for 15 years. This financing package, along with existing cash resources, will fund the drilling, completion and flow testing of C-5H and the installation of the Carpentaria Gas Plant and associated in-field infrastructure. “This represents a key milestone in Empire’s stated goal to move into pilot production from the Beetaloo Basin commencing in 2025 to meet demand for gas in the Northern Territory and, ultimately, Australia’s supply-constrained East Coast market. “The terms of the financing package demonstrate Macquarie’s innovative approach to provision of capital to the upstream oil and gas industry, with significantly reduced dilution of shareholders’ interests in the company compared to raising additional equity capital for the Carpentaria Pilot Project.” The company's war chest has also grown to $34.8 million after receiving $1.3 million from the Australian Taxation Office for September 2024 business activity statements. The surface section of the C-5H well has been successfully drilled and cased, effectively isolating the Cambrian Limestone Aquifer. Empire is currently drilling ahead in the vertical section of the intermediate hole at a depth of 770 metres MD. The well path will soon begin building and turning towards the Middle Velkerri B shale target interval. After the intermediate section is drilled and cased, Empire will drill and case the horizontal section.

This marks the first major international expansion of Remplir outside Australia and New Zealand, where the device has seen rapid adoption and sales growth since its launch. It’s also on the back of Remplir’s recent regulatory approval by Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority, which opens the door for first sales in the first quarter of 2025. The company is committed to accelerating revenue generation in high-potential markets while establishing Remplir as a leading solution in the US$3.5 billion global nerve repair market. Orthocell CEO and MD Paul Anderson said: “Device Technologies Asia is a leading supplier of innovative medical solutions to hospitals and healthcare professionals throughout Singapore and South East Asia. “We are delighted to extend our very successful distribution partnership with Device Technologies in Australia and New Zealand into Singapore. “They have a proven track record in successfully driving the market entry of high-quality products with specialist capabilities and resources, and in the marketing, promotion and distribution of Remplir™. “We are very much looking forward to working with DVT Asia to establish Remplir as the highest quality nerve repair device in Singapore. We expect revenue growth and surgeon adoption of Remplir to accelerate from market launch in Q1 CY25.” Singapore’s status as a strategic hub for advanced medical treatments and a regulatory gateway to ASEAN markets makes it a critical milestone in Orthocell’s global growth strategy. DVT Asia will leverage its strong local presence and established relationships with plastic reconstructive and orthopaedic surgeons to drive market penetration, supported by targeted promotional efforts and medical education initiatives. Orthocell is well-funded for this expansion, with around A$35 million in cash and no debt. The company is also progressing regulatory efforts in other key markets, including the United States, Canada, Europe and additional ASEAN countries. Results from its US market authorisation study and a 510(K) submission are on track for Q4 CY24, with FDA approval expected in early 2025. DTA managing director Nat McLay said: “I am extremely excited to partner with Orthocell to bring their Australian Made range of peripheral nerve repair devices to plastic and orthopaedic surgeons in Singapore. “At Device Technologies Asia we believe in investing in innovative technologies as part of a holistic portfolio that provides value to our customers and benefits their patients. “We look forward to working with the team at Orthocell to improve patient outcomes across the plastic reconstructive and orthopaedic industry.” Dell Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:DELL) posted strong third-quarter earnings driven by record AI server demand, though revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations, sending shares down 5% in postmarket trading.

The drilling returned results of 16 metres at 11.16 g/t gold from 159 metres, which included a bonanza-grade intersection of 1 metre at 148 g/t, and 15 metres at 6.46 g/t from 106 metres, including 3 metres at 19.85 g/t. PDI says the results validate its geological interpretation, which has modelled southwest plunging shoot-like zones of gold mineralisation, outcropping near artisanal workings. Predictive intends to conduct follow-up drilling based on the updated interpretation, infilling the drill pattern around existing holes. Fouwagbe long section “Regional exploration within the highly prospective Bankan Gold Project permits is an important focus for the company and complements the progress being made with permitting and study activities for the NEB and BC deposits,” Predictive Discovery managing director Andrew Pardey said. “A key aim of our regional programs is to define new deposits to grow the project’s overall mineral resources and resource definition drilling is progressing well at the Fouwagbe and Sounsoun targets. “Recent results from Fouwagbe have delivered multiple strong intercepts, further highlighting the potential of the area. “Pleasingly, the results have allowed us to refine the geological model and support further drilling as we work towards a maiden mineral resource estimate. “Resource definition drilling has recently recommenced at Sounsoun and regional exploration at Argo and Bokoro South is ongoing with the aim of defining new promising targets areas.” The drilling at Sounsoun will focus on infilling the central part of the east-west shear zone, which was originally defined by the previous drilling campaign in the region. Predictive expects to produce maiden mineral resource estimates for Fouwagbe and Sounsoun in early 2025, once follow-up drilling and resource modelling is complete.
