SmartAsset&#8217;s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don&#8217;t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) A seismic shift has transformed global manufacturing in recent years, with US and EU companies increasingly moving production from China to India. Accelerated by President Trump’s use of tariffs as trade weapons, this movement began a few years ago as geopolitical tensions and economic pressures began to raise concerns about supply chain resilience. India’s proactive policies have served to drive this trend toward supply chain diversification. While India has made remarkable progress over the past three decades, and holds vast potential as a manufacturing hub, infrastructure gaps and regulatory complexities present challenges. The primary driver is escalating friction with China. U.S.-China trade wars have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods, pushing companies to seek alternatives. From 2018 to 2022, U.S. goods imports from China dropped 10% (inflation-adjusted), while imports from India soared 44%, per trade data. Concerns over intellectual property theft and supply chain risks exposed during COVID-19 further fueled this shift. China’s rising labor and production costs have also eroded its edge in labor-intensive sectors like textiles and electronics, prompting companies to explore cost-competitive alternatives. India has emerged as a prime destination, propelled by initiatives like “Make in India” and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes. These offer tax breaks (e.g., a 17% corporate tax rate for new manufacturing firms), subsidies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), and a stable legal system rooted in British common law, safeguarding intellectual property. India’s youthful workforce (median age 28) and 1.4 billion-strong consumer market enhance its appeal. Apple, for example, has ramped up iPhone production in India, with Foxconn investing $1.5 billion in Tamil Nadu to supply the U.S. market. India’s share of Apple’s iPhone output grew from 2% to 5% between 2021 and 2022, with goals to hit 25%. Other giants like Dell, Nike, Intel, and Nippon Steel are also shifting production, with over 90% of North American manufacturers surveyed by BCG reporting some relocation from China in the past five years. Yet despite India’s appeal, challenges do remain. India’s infrastructure lags, with only 5% of roads classified as highways, causing logistical bottlenecks. Regulatory red tape hinders operations, with just 55% of companies reporting seamless production shifts. Manufacturing costs in India can also run 5–10% higher than in China due to import duties on components. India faces competition from Vietnam, a leader in electronics, and Mexico, advantaged by its proximity to the U.S. Companies and investors must navigate these hurdles to ensure profitability. This shift opens doors for entrepreneurs and businesses. Investors can target Indian firms or ETFs in booming sectors like electronics and semiconductors, which attracted $16 billion in manufacturing FDI from 2020 to 2023. Content creators can monetize blogs or videos on India’s manufacturing surge through ads or sponsorships. Consulting services offer another path, providing market research or regulatory guidance for firms entering India. Businesses can also develop logistics or compliance solutions to address operational challenges. The pivot from China to India reflects geopolitical, economic, and logistical realities. India’s policies and demographic strengths position it as a rising manufacturing powerhouse, but infrastructure and regulatory hurdles require careful strategy. Opportunities in investment, content creation, and consulting abound for those who can navigate India’s complexities with precision. Investors can explore top Indian companies listed on U.S. exchanges, such as HDFC Bank (NYSE: HDB), Infosys (NYSE: INFY), or MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ: MMYT). For broader exposure, the iShares MSCI India ETF (NASDAQ: INDA) tracks the MSCI India Index, covering roughly 85% of India’s large and mid-cap equity market.

Bank of America is bullish on GOOGL, raising its price target to $200 per share from $185 with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating attached. Citi also raised its price target on GOOGL to $200 in the wake of the company&#8217;s strong quarterly results. Piper Sandler predicts GOOGL price will hit $195 and has an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on shares. Wells Fargo analysts lifted their price target on the stock to $175 with an &#8220;equal weight&#8221; rating. GOOGL stock is currently hovering at $163 per share. Markets Attempt Gains 12:08 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market is attempting to move higher, including a 0.36% gain in the Nasdaq Composite. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is holding onto 2% gains while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is soaring by 8%, helping to lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite as autonomous driving makes its way closer to the mainstream. Tesla shares are up 24% over the past five-day stretch. Resilient Consumers 11:21 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer sentiment surprisingly improved toward the end of April amid a resilient consumer despite the tariff uncertainty. The University of Michigan published the final reading of its consumer sentiment index, which rose 52.2 compared with its initial view of 50.8 earlier this month. Economists were expecting the reading to remain flat. Nevertheless, the index fell sharply from March levels and has been on the decline in 2025. Today is the ex-dividend date for Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), CSW Industrials (CSWI) and Fastenal Company (Nasdaq: FAST). After a three-day winning streak, the markets are getting off to a slower start, with all three of the major stock market averages meandering between positive and negative ground this morning. Small-cap stocks are out front with a 2% jump in the Russell 2000 index. Google parent Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is tacking on 4% after yesterday afternoon&#8217;s strong earnings print. Mag 7 stock Alphabet beat consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines, in response to which shares have been soaring ever since. Alphabet reported $2.81 per share on revenue of $90.2 billion compared with Wall Street estimates of $2.01 per share on revenue of $89.1 billion. Bank of America&#8217;s Michael Harnett is bearish on stocks due to the trade uncertainties, advising investors to remain defensive, sell the SPX/US$ rallies and buy price dips in gold. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 61.79 (-0.18%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 8.78 (-0.07%) S&amp;P 500: Down 5.01 (-0.09%) Tech Roundup Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) beat on the top and bottom lines with better than expected profits and revenue. But the markets are focused on the outlook, and Intel&#8217;s revenue guidance for the current quarter fell shy of consensus estimates, sending shares lower by 7% this morning. T-Mobile (Nasdaq: TMUS) shares are under pressure, falling 9% after the company revealed disappointing subscriber numbers in its quarterly print despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Pony AI (Nasdaq: PONY) shares are continuing their wild ride, soaring 17.7% today after yesterday&#8217;s double-digit percentage rally.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a bare 0.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained a more substantial 0.7%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.2% gain. Despite an inauspicious start on Monday, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF&#8217;s gain of 0.7% Friday brought its total gain for the week to 4.6%. For the month of April, however, the Voo remains down 1.5%, with just three trading days remaining. Call It &quot;the Trump Effect&quot; 1:23 pm Markets have turned solidly green in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.66% and the Voo ETF ticking right along in its footsteps with a 0.64% gain. So what&#8217;s changed? Responding to China&#8217;s demurral yesterday that &#8220;there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,&#8221; which was itself in response to President Trump&#8217;s assertion Tuesday that talks were happening, the President insisted again today that, whatever the Chinese government may want people to believe, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been meeting with China&#8221; to talk about lowering tariffs after all. In this game of he said, Xi said, it&#8217;s honestly hard for an investor to know what&#8217;s really going on. But for now at least, the markets seem to believe Mr. Trump, and are hoping the trade war is nearing an end. S&amp;P 500 Just Turned Into a Horse of a Different Color 11:50 am Uh-oh. We&#8217;re 15 minutes from noonday now, and the S&amp;P 500 has just turned red, down 0.12%. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, likewise, has lost its pleasant shade of green, and is now down 0.14%. In happier news (for investors), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) just won a ruling in Texas, where an Outsourcing Facilities Association lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA suing them for making Ozempic copycat drugs just got rejected. S&amp;P 500 component Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) previously won a similar ruling, also in Texas. For the big publicly-traded GLP-1 drugmakers, things are finally going their way. S&amp;P Might Not Bounce Back This Time 10:52 am In mid-morning trading, we&#8217;re getting further disturbing news that may weigh on &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; CNBC reports that S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), or more precisely third party retailers who sell on Amazon, are raising prices on hundreds of items to help them absorb the cost of new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon&#8217;s stock price doesn&#8217;t seem to be suffering from the report yet. It&#8217;s still slightly in the green. But the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t moving any higher, despite trading having begun nearly an hour and a half ago already. And we&#8217;re off! The stock market opened for trading a bit lower today than it left off last night. But within five minutes of opening, the S&amp;P 500 (Index: SPX) was already, if only barely, in the green with an 0.06% gain. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO), which closely tracks the performance of the index, is up 0.09%. It&#8217;s still a hesitant start, but a logical result in light of comments from President Trump, just published by Time magazine, to the effect that the President is looking to end his trade war with China (and the world) perhaps &#8220;a year from now&#8221; and with tariffs on foreign countries settling at &#8220;20% to 50%.&#8221; The prospect of trade war volatility dragging on for another 12 months, and of tariffs ending up two to five times higher than the 10% &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariffs already announced, is clearly not something that investors wanted to hear. Earnings Last night, after the close of trading on a third straight day of gains for &#8220;the Voo,&#8221; index component Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG) (Nasdaq: GOOGL) reported earnings a staggering 40% better than Wall Street analysts were predicting, which seemed propitious enough news to keep the stock market rally going this morning. Unfortunately, comments from Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) seem to have canceled out Alphabet&#8217;s good news. The chipmaker reported a $0.19 per share loss for its own first quarter, warned that it&#8217;s not going to earn a profit in Q2 either (at best, Intel might break even), and its Q2 sales will be about $1 billion less than analysts had forecast. This mixed messaging on the earnings front, for two of the country&#8217;s biggest tech companies, is also weighing on the market today. Analyst Calls Perhaps unlucky for them, Wall Street analysts seem not to have had an opportunity to review the President&#8217;s comments before issuing their latest round of upgrades this morning. Citigroup for example is starting the day off with an upgrade of Hasbro (Nasdaq: HAS) stock, while KeyBanc is upgrading both Lowes (NYSE: LOW) and La-Z-Boy (NYSE: LZB) &#8212; all three of which companies are highly dependent upon goods imported from abroad. If the trade war keeps rumbling, and tariffs keep climbing, things could turn ugly for all of these stocks, and for the S&amp;P 500 in general.

If the gains hold, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for a 5.4% gain this week after taking investors on a roller coaster ride. China is looking ready to negotiate on tariffs, filling in the missing piece of the tariff puzzle that has kept things interesting this week. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) and Monolithic Power (Nasdaq: MPWR) are the top gainers of the day, while Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) and Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) are laggards. First quarter earnings season is officially underway, which could insert another round of uncertainty. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that corporate America would be revising their outlooks downward. But for now, the markets will take the win. Stocks Show Backbone 12:30 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The broader markets are now moving higher, with all three of the major stock market indices trading in the green. It&#8217;s been a topsy turvy trading session as the markets process improving inflation data, faltering consumer confidence and fears of a recession. Fed Official John Williams is stoking fears of inflation rearing its head to the tune of 4% by year-end 2025, pointing to the tariffs as the negative catalyst. He also warned that economic growth could slow to below 1%. S&amp;P 500 component Fastenal (Nasdaq: FAST), which distributes construction supplies, is rising by 6% today after increasing its prices in response to the tariff effect. The company also declared a $0.44 dividend, up from $0.39 previously, alongside its Q1 results. Roller Coaster Ride 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure after the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed weakness. Just about every sector of the economy is now in the red after a mixed showing earlier this morning. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expects corporate America to renege on their earnings outlooks, while BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes an economic recession is brewing. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reported better-than-expected Q1 profits on strong trading volumes. The markets are continuing their roller coaster ride this morning, going from red to green and then back again. This wild week on Wall Street has seen it all, as a perfect storm of trade wars, recession talk and economic uncertainty dominate the headlines. At last check, all three of the major stock market averages were under pressure while sector performance is split between winners and losers. On the economic front, wholesale prices fell more than expected last month, a welcome surprise and an indication of waning inflation. Before the markets had much of a chance to celebrate, another round of economic data swung the other way. Consumer sentiment is down in April, according to the latest University of Michigan poll, as investors lose sleep over the trade war and inflation. The hits keep coming, as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned he expects that S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates will be changed to the downside amid a turbulent economic backdrop. Not to be outdone, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink would not be surprised if there is already a recession emerging in the economy. China has lifted its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% as the trade war saga continues to unfold. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) has kicked off Q1 earnings season with stronger than expected profits, buoyed by high trading volumes. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 166.15 (-0.42%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 106.23 (-0.63%) S&amp;P 500: Down 29.27 (-0.56%) Market Movers Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is extending its rally, rising 7% on the day as investors flock to safe-haven assets like gold. Wall Street firm UBS upgraded its rating on NEM to buy with a $60 price target attached. The stock is currently hovering at just over $54 per share.

The S&amp;P 500 has been buoyed by stocks like Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) while Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) got off to a slower start. President Trump is expected to hold a news conference on reciprocal tariffs this afternoon, which should be positive for the auto sector. Tesla is extending its gains in morning trading, rising by nearly 4% after securing a massive $400 million contract from the U.S. government for its armored vehicles. Separately, following Elon Musk’s nearly $100 billion bid for OpenAI, the serial acquirer said he would drop his offer if the company remains in its current structure as a non-profit, according to reports. OpenAI backer Microsoft is trading slightly lower at last check. Here’s a look at market performance as of mid-morning: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 80 points (+0.18) Nasdaq Composite: Up 157.29 points (+0.83%) S&amp;P 500: Up 30.11 points (+0.50) Key Points Stocks are attempting gains out of the gate in the face of hot inflation data. Tesla is a catalyst after the EV maker landed a lucrative government contract. Earnings season rolls on. Market Movers Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is getting a pop, rising almost 2% as of mid-morning. Some insider buying activity could be sparking gains as the company’s chief commercial officer scooped up $500,000 worth of shares in his first purchase in years. Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) continues its bullish run with an impressive 8% gain on the day. The stock hasn’t put on a show like this in over 20 years. Robinhood (Nasdaq: HOOD) stock is racing ahead by a double-digit percentage on strong earnings including a whopping 700% y-o-y increase in cryptocurrency revenue. Analyst firm Baird is reportedly bullish on energy services play GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), saying the company is well positioned to meet growing energy demand. Baird analysts started coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating and $448 price target attached. The stock is up 1.5% today. Casino operator MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) is soaring about 14% on the day, buoyed by a strong earnings print, further buoyed by China and a rosy forecast. Hertz (Nasdaq: HTZ) shares are sinking in response to weaker-than-expected quarterly results, including a wider loss than anticipated. The stock is down over 4%, owing to its failed push into electric vehicles for which it featured Teslas.

INTC,2024-12-27 04:30:39,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241227.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tens of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 12/20/2024 Morgan Stanley analysts have lowered their price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $169 to $158, while maintaining an “equal weight” rating on the stock. Despite this lowered target, it still suggest a potential upside of 30.75% from AMD’s current price. 12/18/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock has reached a 52-week low of $121.82, valuing the company at $199 billion. This decline, coupled with a beta of 1.64, indicates significant price volatility as investors grapple with economic uncertainties and shifting market dynamics. 12/16/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock price dipped 1.3% in midday trading today, reaching a low of $123.12. Trading volume was also much lower than average, with only 15.7 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock experienced a slight decline of 0.2% during today’s midday trading, fluctuating between $129.13 and $129.92. Trading volume was also much lower than average. 12/11/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ CEO Lisa Su has been named Time Magazine’s CEO of the year. Since taking over in 2014, Su has orchestrated an incredible turnaround for the company, driving AMD’s stock price up by a staggering 3700%. 12/9/2024 Vivek Arya, an analyst with Bank of America, downgraded Advanced Micro Devices stock from “Buy” to “Neutral” and lowered its price target from $180 to $155. This downgrade follows Amazon’s executives reports of weak demand for AMD’s AI accelerators and led to a decline in AMD’s stock today. 12/6/2024 AMD’s stock price has gone down today. This decrease followed an Amazon executive’s report that the company hasn’t observed enough demand for AMD’s AI accelerators to warrant their sale through Amazon Web Services. 12/5/2024 Mizuho has lowered its price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $185 to $180, but still maintains a “Buy” rating on the stock. This revised target price suggests a potential upside of 26.64% from AMD’s current market price. 12/3/2024 Advanced Micro Devices stock declined 0.3% today, trading between $141.23 and $141.61. 11/27/2024 Advanced Micro Devices has solidified its commitment to Indian by inaugurating a new research and development center. This move aligns with the company’s previously announced $400 million investment in the country. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD’s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024. Fiscal Year (Dec) Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $2.87 $3.991 B -($660 M) 2016 $11.34 $4.319 B -($498 M) 2017 $10.28 $5.253 B -($33 M) 2018 $18.46 $6.475 B $337 M 2019 $45.86 $6.731 B $341 M 2020 $91.71 $9.763 B $2.490 B 2021 $143.90 $16.434 B $3.162 B 2022 $64.77 $23.601 B $1.320 B 2023 $147.41 $22.680 B $864 M 2024 LTM (Jun 2024) $$162.21 $23.276 B $$1.354 B Key Drivers for AMD’s Stock in the Future Lisa Su’s release of AMD’s MI300 GPU has thrown down the gauntlet for AI to her cousin, CEO Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which controls close to 70% of the AI GPU market at present. AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 47.99% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 62.48% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.

INTC,2024-12-11 03:58:48,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-price-prediction-and-forecast-20252030-20241211.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tents of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 12/9/2024 Vivek Arya, an analyst with Bank of America, downgraded Advanced Micro Devices stock from “Buy” to “Neutral” and lowered its price target from $180 to $155. This downgrade follows Amazon’s executives reports of weak demand for AMD’s AI accelerators and led to a decline in AMD’s stock today. 12/6/2024 AMD’s stock price has gone down today. This decrease followed an Amazon executive’s report that the company hasn’t observed enough demand for AMD’s AI accelerators to warrant their sale through Amazon Web Services. 12/5/2024 Mizuho has lowered its price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $185 to $180, but still maintains a “Buy” rating on the stock. This revised target price suggests a potential upside of 26.64% from AMD’s current market price. 12/3/2024 Advanced Micro Devices stock declined 0.3% today, trading between $141.23 and $141.61. 11/27/2024 Advanced Micro Devices has solidified its commitment to Indian by inaugurating a new research and development center.

After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024. Fiscal Year (Dec) Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $2.87 $3.991 B -($660 M) 2016 $11.34 $4.319 B -($498 M) 2017 $10.28 $5.253 B -($33 M) 2018 $18.46 $6.475 B $337 M 2019 $45.86 $6.731 B $341 M 2020 $91.71 $9.763 B $2.490 B 2021 $143.90 $16.434 B $3.162 B 2022 $64.77 $23.601 B $1.320 B 2023 $147.41 $22.680 B $864 M 2024 LTM (Jun 2024) $$162.21 $23.276 B $$1.354 B Key Drivers for AMD’s Stock in the Future Lisa Su’s release of AMD’s MI300 GPU has thrown down the gauntlet for AI to her cousin, CEO Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which controls close to 70% of the AI GPU market at present. AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 42.53% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 48.31% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.

Meanwhile, global advertising stocks rallied as Omnicom and Interpublic neared a long-awaited union that would reshape the industry . Interpublic surged premarket, and shares in European rivals Publicis and WPP rose. South Korean markets came under renewed pressure after the leader of the country's ruling party said embattled president Yoon Suk Yeol would no longer be involved in running the country , in a move aimed at stabilizing state affairs. Investors were also assessing developments in the Middle East, where the Assad family dictatorship collapsed over the weekend. Rebel forces claimed control of Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia. Also this week, central banks in Europe and Canada will meet to decide on interest rates. Premarket Movers Apollo Global Management and Workday, will be added to the S&P 500 in the index's quarterly rebalancing, replacing Qorvo and Amentum Holdings, both of which will move to the S&P Small Cap 600 index. Apollo Global was up 6.1% and Workday rose 10%. Qorvo and Amentum fell. AppLovin fell 5.4% after it wasn't added to the S&P 500. Barron's had reported Friday that AppLovin, Apollo, and Coinbase Global were leading candidates that might be added to the index because they have three of the largest market values of any companies not in the S&P 500. Coinbase declined 1.8%. Super Micro Computer said it has been granted an extension from Nasdaq that gives the server marker until Feb. 25, 2025, to file its latest annual report and that it expects to file by the deadline. Shares rose 9.2% Tesla was up 2.1%. Watch For: Oracle 2Q earnings Today's Headlines/Must Reads: - Tapped-Out Private-Equity Investors Decline New Commitments - New York City's Biggest Office Landlord Offers a Glimpse of the Market's Comeback - Why Tariffs Could Really Pinch Retailers This Time MARKET WRAPS Forex: The dollar edged lower as investors bet on the Fed cutting interest rates further this month, Swissquote Bank said. Friday's nonfarm payrolls data boosted market expectations for the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at the December 18 meeting, supporting the case for a softer dollar even as investors seek safe haven assets amid global political turmoil. The euro could fall to $1.0500 in the short-term or even lower after the U.S. inflation data and the ECB policy decision later this week, according to ING. Core inflation might have accelerated in November, bringing into question if the Fed would be right to be cutting interest rates and the ECB is likely to cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday which might open the door to taking rates below the so-called neutral rate that neither spurs nor slows growth, ING said. Sterling rose after China's pledge for more proactive fiscal stimulus Monex Europe said. The announcement was supporting risk appetite and offering tailwinds to sterling, it said. Energy: Oil rose on greater uncertainty in the Middle East after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime fell. ""The geopolitical situation in the Middle East is likely to remain tense in the coming days following the collapse of Syria's government,"" ANZ Research said. Still, gains are capped by persistent concerns over global demand and an impending glut despite OPEC+'s decision to extend a series of production cuts. The weak demand outlook was also underscored by Saudi Arabia's decision to lower its January prices for crude grades it sells to Asia, its main market. Focus this week will be on China's Central Economic Work Conference, as well as monthly reports from OPEC, the IEA and the EIA. DNB Markets said Saudi Arabia's decision to cut official oil selling prices for Asia underscores weaker demand in the continent. Aramco will sell January loadings of its flagship Arab Light grade to Asian buyers at a premium of $0.90 a barrel to the regional Dubai/Oman benchmark, compared with $1.70 in December. ""This is the lowest premium to Dubai since the start of 2021, and at the same time as OPEC has extended its production cuts."" Metals: Gold futures rose on geopolitical risk and central bank purchases. The precious metal has gained on safe-haven demand after the Syrian rebels seized Damascus. Israel seized the demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria over the weekend. A softer dollar has further enhanced gold's appeal as a safe-haven. China's central bank also resumed purchases of bullions in November after a six-month pause, which should shore up Chinese investor demand. Gold Chart Comex gold futures' bullish setup is still valid, based on the daily chart, RHB Retail Research said. Friday's price movements have reaffirmed that bears are respecting the immediate support pegged at $2,640. TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES Meet the Small AI Chip Maker Now More Valuable Than Intel Matt Murphy has no interest in running a chip company 10 times the size of his current one. It is the smarter move, and actually the more ambitious one. Murphy, who has served as chief executive officer of Marvell Technology since 2016, has been among the few names floated as potential replacements for the recently ousted Pat Gelsinger at Intel's corner office. That led to the rare sight of a CEO using his own earnings call to deny that he is on the market. Apple Tops the List of Best-Managed Companies of 2024 Technology companies continue to hold most of the top spots in the annual Management Top 250 ranking of America's best-run companies, with Apple unseating Microsoft at No. 1. Rounding out the top four are Nvidia, Microsoft-which came in at No. 1 the previous four years-and Intel. BP, Japan's JERA to Invest Up to $5.8 Billion to Create Offshore Wind JV British energy giant BP and Japanese power-generation company JERA will invest $5.8 billion to create a global offshore wind-energy joint venture. The companies said Monday that the standalone company will have 13 gigawatt of potential net generating capacity. China Adopts Crisis-Era Language as Leaders Signal More Forceful Stimulus BEIJING-China's leaders signaled a more forceful policy approach to shoring up the economy as Beijing braces for trade tensions under the incoming Trump administration, employing language they haven't used since the depths of the global financial crisis. The 24-man Politburo, China's top decision-making body, pledged Monday to implement more proactive fiscal policy and to adopt a ""moderately loose"" monetary policy next year-the first introduction of such language since 2008. Why Tariffs Could Really Pinch Retailers This Time Many retailers came through relatively unscathed by Donald Trump's tariffs imposed starting in 2018. This time around, though, tariffs have the potential to bite more. Trump has proposed a universal tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports to the U.S. and a 60% or more tariff on goods from China. Somewhat confusingly, Trump has also separately threatened 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on China over immigration and drug issues. Trump Says He Has No Plan to Remove Powell at Fed President-elect Donald Trump said he had no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Trump fielded a question about whether he planned to replace Powell, who has said he would not leave the job even if asked to do so. ""No, I don't think so. I don't see it,"" Trump answered. U.S. Scrambles to Shape Post-Assad Syria but Has to Overcome Years of Disengagement WASHINGTON-The unexpectedly rapid downfall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria has turned the country's future from a back-burner issue to a suddenly high-stakes concern for the departing Biden administration-and almost certainly for Donald Trump. U.S. officials are scrambling to assess the intentions of the rebel groups that drove Assad into exile, especially Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is expected to play a pivotal role in whatever government emerges in Damascus but which is on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. Israeli Airstrikes Target Syrian Chemical-Weapons Systems TEL AVIV-Israel said it had struck chemical-weapons caches and other missile and air-defense systems in Syria on Monday, taking advantage of the chaos there to destroy what it sees as dangerous assets that could fall into rebel hands. Since the stunning assault by Syrian rebels that brought down the regime of President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, Israel said it has taken immediate steps to ensure the protection of its border amid the uncertainty engulfing the country. This includes striking targets across Syria and swiftly seizing a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria as well as adjacent points. Inside Ukraine's Battle for the Skies as Russian Bombardments Hit Records POLTAVA, Ukraine-A team of soldiers sat inside a nondescript red bus with their eyes glued to a bank of screens blinking with yellow dots. The shapes represented Russian drones, missiles and planes cutting into Ukrainian skies. Soldiers from Ukraine's 164th Radiotechnical Brigade were trying to quickly identify targets and intercept them before they could sow destruction in towns and cities.

INTC,2024-11-19 04:01:43,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241119.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tens of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 11/18/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’s stock price is on the rise today following the announcement of a partnership with IBM. The two tech giants are teaming up to deploy AMD’s next-generation MI300X accelerators on IBM Cloud. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD’s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024.

AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12-months is $186.91, which is 37.75% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 51.23% increase. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 39.74% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.

INTC,2024-11-14 23:19:47,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241114.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tens of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market but simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.
