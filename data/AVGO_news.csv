AVGO,2025-06-06 10:43:48,Rubrik (RBRK) Earnings Live:,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/rubrik-rbrk-earnings-live-20250606.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Rubrik the Rare Winner Tonight 5:04 pm by Joel South Tonight&#8217;s most anticipated earnings have generally been dreary. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign down 16%, and Broadcom is down 4%. So, perhaps its not surprising that after initial gains of 6%, shares of Rubrick are now flat after-hours as of 5:05 p.m. ET. The company still has its earnings call, but after a furious rally in stocks across the past two months, expectations for earnings have clearly risen. Shares Surge on Strong Earnings 4:34 pm by Joel South Shares of RBRK soared in after-hours trading after reporting strong Q1 results. The stock is up 6.02% since the close. Rubrik kicked off its FY 2026 with impressive Q1 results, exceeding all guided metrics and showcasing strong growth across key areas. The cyber resilience company reported a 49% year-over-year revenue increase to $278.5 million and a 38% rise in subscription annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $1.18 billion. The company now has 2,381 customers generating over $100K in subscription ARR, up 28% from the prior year. CEO Bipul Sinha credited the results to focused innovation and execution, while CFO Kiran Choudary highlighted ongoing progress toward profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin improved to 80.5%, and free cash flow turned positive at $33.3 million. Rubrik also announced major partnerships with Google Cloud, Deloitte, NTT Data and Rackspace to expand its data protection and AI security offerings. Looking ahead, Rubrik projects Q2 revenue between $281 million and $283 million and expects full-year revenue to reach up to $1.19 billion. Risks 3:32 pm 1. Channel Saturation and GTM Efficiency PressureRubrik is scaling fast, but sales and marketing spend remains high. If CAC payback extends or sales cycles elongate — especially in regulated verticals — investors may question whether the growth is too expensive. High cash burn without operating leverage risks a rerating, even if ARR expands. 2. Competitive Intensity and Pricing RiskRubrik competes with Veeam, Cohesity, and emerging vendors — many with lower-cost backup offerings. While Rubrik has positioned itself as a premium, AI-native cyber recovery platform, pricing pressure could emerge in mid-market deals or renewals. Any sign of discounting or ASP compression would undercut gross margin confidence. 3. Reliance on Cloud PartnershipsRubrik’s Microsoft and AWS integrations are strengths — but also dependencies. If those partners pivot product strategy, shift co-selling alignment, or prioritize their own tools, Rubrik’s funnel could be disrupted. Partner fatigue or shifting incentives are execution risks not fully priced in. 4. IPO Transition and Reporting ScrutinyAs a newly public company, Rubrik must now meet the rigor of quarterly financial scrutiny. Any inconsistency in disclosure, slippage in RPO, or misalignment between growth and margin could trigger outsized stock reactions. Execution discipline — not just topline growth — will define Rubrik’s post-IPO multiple. Keys to Watch 3:31 pm 1. ARR Growth Trajectory and Large Deal MixWith ~$784M in ARR entering Q1, the Street expects Rubrik to exit FY25 on a ~$1B ARR run-rate. Key to this is continued growth in $1M+ ARR customers and large enterprise wins. Investors will be looking for sequential adds in that cohort, as well as commentary on deal cycles and retention. 2. Microsoft Partnership ActivationRubrik’s GTM alignment with Microsoft — particularly around Azure and Office 365 data protection — is seen as a key differentiator. This quarter, investors want evidence that joint field activity is translating to pipeline conversion, particularly in mid-market and public sector verticals. Deal attribution commentary will be closely parsed. 3. Gross Margin Stability and Product ExpansionLast reported gross margin was 78%, among the highest in SaaS. If this holds or improves, it supports the long-term model of Rubrik as a profitable security platform. Management may offer commentary on adoption of new SKUs — including sensitive data classification and policy automation tools — which could lift ASP and reduce churn. 4. RPO Conversion and Billing PatternsRubrik’s RPO grew 55% YoY last reported, and Q1 is expected to show how much of that is converting to near-term revenue. Investors will track deferred revenue build and renewal velocity to assess whether the business is front-loaded or recurring. Clean billings execution would reinforce ARR confidence. Consensus Estimates 3:30 pm Q1 FY2025 Street Estimates: Revenue: $187.2M (+38% YoY) Adjusted EPS: –$0.33 Gross Margin: ~78% Adj. EBITDA: –$32.4M ARR (prior disclosed): $784M Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO): $811M Growth Metrics to Watch: $1M+ ARR Customers: 117 last reported (+66% YoY) Net Revenue Retention: ~120% Multi-product adoption rate: &gt;50% The Street expects Rubrik to sustain strong revenue momentum into Q2, with guide implications pointing to $200M+ quarterly run-rate before year-end. Analysts are looking for updates to customer count, upsell trends, and vertical-specific traction, particularly in public sector, healthcare, and regulated industries. Cash burn will remain elevated — EBITDA losses are expected near $30M+ — but the focus is on narrowing those losses quarter over quarter while maintaining high ARR expansion and multi-product attach rates. Any progress toward FCF breakeven or improved CAC payback would be viewed as a sign of operational maturity. Rubrik enters its first earnings release as a public company with significant expectations baked into its valuation and narrative. The cybersecurity and data resilience platform is positioned as a high-growth, cloud-native alternative to legacy backup and recovery vendors — and the Street is watching closely to see whether that pitch holds up under public scrutiny. Consensus expects $187.2M in revenue (+38% YoY) and an adjusted EPS loss of –$0.33, sharply improved from –$1.58 YoY. The quarter will test Rubrik’s ability to maintain hypergrowth while narrowing losses and will serve as the first checkpoint for public market investors to evaluate execution quality, GTM leverage, and forward ARR visibility. Management previously disclosed ARR of $784M and 55% YoY growth in RPO. This quarter is expected to show continued traction in large enterprise deals — especially those tied to Microsoft cloud workloads. A key test will be whether customers adopting Rubrik Security Cloud are scaling usage and adding modules such as threat detection, compliance auditing, and ransomware response automation. Given Rubrik’s premium valuation and compressed FCF profile, execution on both growth and efficiency must be crisp. Investors will seek signals that sales productivity is improving, gross margins remain near 78%, and that runway remains long even as growth decelerates modestly from IPO-era acceleration.

AVGO,2025-06-06 10:43:48,Broadcom (AVGO) Earnings Live: What To Expect From 2Q Results,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/broadcom-avgo-earnings-live-what-to-expect-from-2q-20250606.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call is Starting Now 5:07 pm by Joel South Broadcom&#8217;s conference call is starting now. You can listen in here if you&#8217;d like. The stock is currently down 3.4%. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that almost every major stock reporting tonight is seeing red after-hours. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign is down 16%, and Rubrik jumped 6% after its earnings were released. However, its shares are now flat. Translation: After a furious two-month stock market rally, investors expectations for what companies should be delivering has risen. If any material news impacts Broadcom&#8217;s share price during its conference call we&#8217;ll post an update. One Standout Figure from Broadcom&#039;s Earnings 4:41 pm by Eric Bleeker One figure to pay attention to is that Broadcom is guiding to AI revenue next quarter of $5.1 billion, that&#8217;s above Wall Street&#8217;s expectations of $4.8 billion. Keep in mind that Broadcom&#8217;s stock has moved significantly in recent quarters based on conference call commentary, so where it&#8217;s trading right now (-2.5%) could be very different than where it opens tomorrow if the company&#8217;s CEO gives some especially bullish comments about future AI demand. It&#039;s a Beat and Raise for Broadcom - So Why Aren&#039;t Shares Moving? 4:37 pm by Joel South Broadcom issued a beat and raise for tonight&#8217;s earnings, not only surpassing last quarter&#8217;s expectations from Wall Street, but also topping guidance. So why aren&#8217;t the share moving north after-hours? Simply put, Broadcom has rallied a remarkable 78% since April 4th, so plenty of optimism was built in headed into these earnings. A slight beat and guide for the coming quarter above consensus is generally expected when stocks have rallied as furiously as Broadcom has in recent months. Make no mistake, Broadcom&#8217;s quarter was solid and its guidance for next quarter points to continuing momentum. However, the results are also not far enough above consensus to move the needle much after Broadcom&#8217;s recent run. Broadcom Shares are Rebounding 4:29 pm by Joel South Broadcom shares are rebounding, now roughly flat after initially dropping several percent after the company&#8217;s earnings release. Shares Slide Despite Record Q2 Results on Surging AI Demand 4:26 pm by Joel South Broadcom posted strong Q2 results, with revenue climbing 20% year-over-year to a record $15 billion, fueled by rapid growth in AI semiconductor demand and contributions from VMware. The company reported GAAP net income of $5 billion and non-GAAP net income of $7.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 35% to $10.0 billion, representing 67% of revenue. AI revenue reached $4.4 billion in Q2, up 46% from the previous year, and is projected to grow further to $5.1 billion in Q3. CEO Hock Tan noted continued investment from hyperscale partners and 10 straight quarters of AI revenue growth. Broadcom also generated $6.4 billion in free cash flow, returning $7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. The company expects Q3 revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and maintains strong profitability guidance. Despite this, shares slipped in after-hour trading 28.6% from the close. Execution Risks 3:33 pm by Joel South Despite strong momentum, Broadcom’s Q2 setup is not without potential downside risks. The most immediate is hyperscaler AI capex cyclicality. While demand remains strong, cloud buildouts can be lumpy, and any signal of Q3 digestion or budget reallocation — especially in networking — could imply slower sequential growth, even if the long-term trajectory remains intact. On the software side, customer churn within VMware remains a meaningful risk. Broadcom’s go-to-market changes — including consolidation of SKUs and tighter bundling — could alienate long-time customers, especially in segments like EUC (End-User Computing) that are being divested or deemphasized. If bookings slow or renewal rates dip below plan, the market may question whether VMware revenue is truly durable. Another issue is regulatory scrutiny and deal pipeline constraints. Broadcom has long relied on M&amp;A to build scale and pricing power. But with global regulators now increasingly aggressive, further transformative acquisitions could face long timelines or outright rejection, limiting long-term inorganic growth potential. Finally, valuation has expanded significantly. The stock trades at ~25x forward EPS — toward the high end of its historical range. That leaves limited room for error on the Q2 results or full-year guide. If margins contract, or if guidance remains unchanged despite tailwinds, the bar may prove too high. Keys to Watch 3:32 pm by Joel South 1. GenAI Ethernet Momentum and ASP Trends:The durability of Broadcom’s AI networking tailwind is the single most important question heading into this release. Investors want to know if demand from hyperscalers is accelerating, stabilizing, or softening — and whether AVGO is gaining share vs. InfiniBand-based alternatives like Nvidia’s Mellanox stack. A beat in networking and bullish comments on demand visibility into 2H FY24 would reinforce Broadcom’s role as a backbone infrastructure supplier for AI training and inference clusters. 2. VMware Margins, Churn, and Booking Signals:While headline growth will be boosted by VMware consolidation, investors care more about how profitable those dollars are. If VMware segment operating margin exceeds 60% or gross margin trends toward the high-70s, the software synergy thesis gains credibility. Watch closely for commentary on customer renewals, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), and any soft patches in product overlap areas. 3. Guidance Lift and Fiscal Discipline:Management has guided conservatively over the past year, often beating internally restrained expectations. If Broadcom raises its full-year revenue outlook to $51B or above and holds EBITDA margin at 60%, it would confirm confidence in both software execution and sustained AI spend. That could justify further multiple expansion in the mid-20x EPS range. Core Results &amp; Segment Highlights 3:31 pm by Joel South Q2 FY2024 Street Estimates: Revenue: $12.04B Adjusted EPS: $10.84 YoY Revenue Growth: +37.6% Adj. Gross Margin (guide): ~75% Adj. EBITDA Margin (guide): 60% FY24 (Implied): Full-Year Revenue Guide (prior): $50B AI Infrastructure Run-Rate (last disclosed): $1B/quarter VMware Contribution Estimate (Q2): ~$2.3B Legacy Semiconductor Core (ex-VMware): ~$9.7B Broadcom has beaten Street EPS estimates in each of the last 12 quarters. Last quarter, it reported EPS of $10.99 on $11.96B in revenue, exceeding guidance on both lines and attributing the strength primarily to AI-related Ethernet demand and an unexpectedly smooth start to VMware integration. This quarter, analysts are expecting flat-to-up sequential trends in networking, mid-single-digit growth in broadband, and mid-teens growth in wireless — all consistent with seasonal patterns. Software is expected to rise sharply YoY due to VMware, but investors will differentiate between organic Broadcom software and new VMware revenue. Most expect VMware to contribute &gt;$2B per quarter with 70–75% gross margin and 55–60% EBITDA margin — if Broadcom delivers higher, that would confirm synergy realization is ahead of pace. Notably, guidance will carry more weight than the headline numbers. Street models are anticipating an update to full-year revenue closer to $51B and potential EBITDA upside if VMware cost actions flow through earlier than planned. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) enters its Q2 FY2024 earnings release as one of the most closely watched semiconductor and infrastructure software plays, sitting squarely at the intersection of two defining technology narratives: hyperscale AI infrastructure deployment and large-scale software consolidation. Expectations are high across the board, and the stock has reflected that enthusiasm — surging over 30% in the past month to all-time highs, with investors pricing in both generative AI upside and a smooth VMware integration path. Analysts are modeling $12.04B in revenue (+37.6% YoY) and $10.84 in adjusted EPS, with roughly $2.3B expected from VMware in its first full quarter post-acquisition. The remainder of the growth is expected to come from AI-enabling components — especially Broadcom’s switch ASICs, custom silicon, and Ethernet fabric interconnects, which are widely deployed by hyperscale customers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The company previously disclosed that GenAI-related sales were running at a $1B quarterly pace — and any update on that figure will be a core focus. Broadcom’s results will serve as a high-stakes litmus test for enterprise AI infrastructure demand, especially given recent mixed signals from peers. Nvidia has flagged broad-based hyperscaler spend, while Marvell noted pushouts. Broadcom’s exposure is deeper in networking, and the expectation is for that segment to grow over 50% YoY, barring any cloud digestion pause. Just as important is the VMware narrative. Management previously guided to 60% EBITDA margins on a combined basis and expressed confidence that early cost synergies would materialize faster than expected. But as VMware customer contracts turn over, the Street wants proof that Broadcom can retain revenue while simplifying the product portfolio. Any sign of subscription churn or integration friction could undercut the broader software platform thesis.

AVGO,2025-06-06 10:43:48,"If I Could Go Back, I’d Start Investing in Dividends at 20 – Here’s Why Timing Matters",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/if-i-could-go-back-id-start-investing-in-20250606.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"At what age would you buy dividend stocks if you could go back in time? The Dividends subreddit was bustling after one investor asked if people regretted buying dividend stocks too early or too late in their journey. For instance, some people may regret buying dividend stocks in their 20s because they saw growth stocks outperform them for more than a decade. On the other hand, other investors may wish they got into dividend stocks in their 40s instead of waiting for their 60s due to market volatility and steep losses from unprofitable investments. Dividend investors shared their thoughts and some advice for people who are considering dividend stocks. Key Points Should you buy dividend stocks in your 20s? Redditors shared their thoughts. Dividend growth stocks make more sense for younger investors, but high-yield stocks become a priority as people get older and approach retirement. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Buy Stocks For The Long Run One of the top comments came from a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) investor who bought shares at $6 apiece and held on to them. The investor now has 1,110 shares and receives an annual dividend that is close to 16% of the initial investment. That&#8217;s the advantage of buying dividend growth stocks. These corporations pay dividends but still have plenty of growth prospects left. Even at its current level of success, Walmart still has growth opportunities. Online advertising, e-commerce, and retail locations are some of the company&#8217;s growth levers. Buying dividend stocks doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be stuck with mature, high-yield companies. For instance, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a dividend yield above 1% and has crushed the stock market with a 685% gain over the past five years. Why Wait To Invest? Multiple dividend investors asked why people would wait to invest. Some people said they wished they could invest when they were born, while others wished they invested in their early 20s. People weren&#8217;t expressing regret about entering stocks in their 20s and 30s. Waiting to invest doesn&#8217;t make much sense if you want to become wealthy. The longer you let your money sit in the stock market, the more time you have to compound your returns. Waiting to invest causes your money to lose value due to inflation. A high-yield savings account is better than nothing, but it can&#8217;t appreciate like dividend stocks. You only get the cash flow from a bank account, while dividend stocks can double in value over the course of 5-10 years. Transition To High-Yield Dividend Stocks When You Need Steady Income A few dividend investors said that it makes sense to diversify into high-yield stocks when they need additional income. Many investors focused on dividend growth stocks or index funds that tracked major indices like the S&amp;P 500 when they were younger. Then, they gradually sold off some of those holdings and shifted into funds with lower risk and higher yields. Every person has a different financial situation and long-term goals. If you don&#8217;t need to sell your assets within the next decade and don&#8217;t need dividend income, it may make more sense to focus on growth-oriented opportunities. However, your plans may look different if you want to sell your stocks in 1-3 years to buy a house. Then, it may be better to take a cautious approach and focus on funds that have high yields and steady growth instead of riskier funds that aim to produce 10%+ annualized returns. If you&#8217;re just getting started, you can diversify your portfolio with dividend stocks and growth-oriented stocks. Reinvesting dividends ensures that your dividend income grows over time and can eventually cover your living expenses. Monitoring dividend stocks can help you build a robust portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

Wall Street Bullish on This Big Tech Stock 9:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts have turned increasingly bullish on Amazon stock. Here&#8217;s a roundup of the most recent analyst moves: Earlier this week, BofA reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN and raised its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts highlighted Amazon’s advancements in robotics and AI, noting these could add approximately 2 percentage points to retail margins, supporting further upside. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating and increased its price target from $225 to $240. The firm emphasized Amazon’s leadership in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), along with margin tailwinds and a strong free cash flow (FCF) ramp, fueling a bullish long-term outlook. Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $240, noting that delays in Amazon’s Project Kuiper (satellite internet initiative) are expected and priced into the stock. They expressed confidence in Amazon’s 2025 launch cadence and cost guidance for the project. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain fickle, but today there is reason to be optimistic. Discussions have reemerged between the White House and Beijing, according to Chinese media reports. This has revived the &#8216;risk-on&#8217; trade and sent major stock market indices higher across the board. In a last-ditch effort, officials from both sides are trying to salvage trade talks that had previously stalled. Sectors of the economy are mixed today, with no clear conviction in either direction. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been capturing attention lately, most recently for announcing a $10 billion bet on AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock is up 1.7% today. Additionally, the markets are keeping an eye on the broader S&amp;P 500 index, which will announce changes to its member lineup on Friday. Bank of America has offered its two cents, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) could muscle their way into the index. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 60.49 (+0.14%) Nasdaq Composite: 72.99 (+0.38%) S&amp;P 500: Up 16.85 (+0.28%) Market Movers In a bullish move for Big Tech, analyst firm Daiwa has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock, lifting the price target to $165 per share, reflecting upside potential of 17%. Separately, Bank of America analysts reemphasized NVDA stock as one of their top picks with a $180 price objective, saying it&#8217;s in the best spot to capture the benefits of the &#8220;AI tide.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is losing close to 5% today after Elon Musk turned his attention to the U.S. tax bill. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) will release its quarterly results after the closing bell today. The stock is trading slightly lower this morning.

AVGO,2025-06-05 10:30:05,S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) Live: Markets Remain Jumpy Despite China Trade Deal Optimism,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/sp-500-nysearca-spy-live-markets-remain-jumpy-despite-20250605.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Wall Street Bullish on Big Tech 10:17 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts are showing growing optimism regarding Amazon stock. Below is a summary of the latest analyst actions: Earlier this week, BofA reconfirmed its Buy rating for Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), elevating its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts underscored Amazon&#8217;s progress in robotics and artificial intelligence, suggesting these innovations could boost retail margins by roughly two percentage points, thereby supporting additional upside. JPMorgan sustained its Overweight rating and adjusted its price target upward from $225 to $240. The firm underscored Amazon&#8217;s dominant position in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), alongside favorable margin trends and a robust FCF acceleration, contributing to a positive long-term outlook. Barclays maintained an Overweight rating with a $240 price target, commenting that anticipated delays in Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper (its satellite internet venture) are already factored into the stock&#8217;s valuation. They conveyed confidence in Amazon&#8217;s 2025 launch schedule and cost projections for the initiative. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain unpredictable, and today is no exception. After starting out of the gate higher on trade talk hopes, stocks have since erased those gains. According to Chinese state media, talks have resumed between the White House and Beijing. In a final push, officials from both nations are attempting to rescue stalled trade negotiations. This appeared to have reignited the &#8220;risk-on&#8221; sentiment, but the markets have since taken a nosedive. Economic sectors are showing mixed signals today, lacking a decisive direction. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is now down 0.20% on the day. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been in the spotlight recently, particularly after unveiling a $10 billion investment in AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock has climbed 1.7% today. Meanwhile, the broader S&amp;P 500 index is under scrutiny as it prepares to announce changes to its constituent companies on Friday. Bank of America has weighed in, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) might gain entry into the index. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 113.82 (-0.27%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 45.89 (-0.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 15.37 (-0.25%) Market Movers In a strong vote of confidence for Big Tech, analyst firm Daiwa has reaffirmed its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock, increasing its price target to $165 per share, indicating a potential upside of 17%. Separately, Bank of America analysts reiterated NVDA stock as a top selection with a $180 price objective, stating it&#8217;s ideally positioned to ride the &#8220;AI tide.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is down nearly 5% today after Elon Musk commented on the U.S. tax bill. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) is set to release its quarterly earnings after the market closes today. The stock is trading marginally lower this morning.

Five fascinating funds will tempt income seekers with potent yields and strong growth prospects. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Stock picking is fine, but exchange traded funds (ETFs) can enable immediate diversification without sacrificing growth and income opportunities. By selecting multiple funds instead of just one, you can achieve an extra measure of safety while also turning your portfolio into a veritable income-generating machine. The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/03/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-passive-income-machines/

You can try all four of these high-yield ETFs for diversified exposure to a wide range of stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In recent years, ultra-high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs) have opened the door to new possibilities for aggressive income harvesters. If you pick your ETFs carefully, you can practically turn your portfolio into a passive income machine. Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-passive-income-machines/

ETFs come in a wide range of configurations, and are generally passively managed and designed to mimic the performance of designated market indexes. Key Points Dividend growth, in the majority of cases, is a stock indicator of a company’s business success, since dividend growth usually is commensurate with profit growth. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF is a popular ETF platform for investors to avail themselves of blue chip companies with a steady track record for both dividend increases and price appreciation growth. Deployment of a dividend reinvestment protocol can substantially boost overall ROI for investments in an ETF such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF.

The S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index is one such benchmark. Containing Dividend Kings (50 or more consecutive years of increased dividends) and Dividend Aristocrats (25 or more years in a row of increased dividends), this index contains Fortune 500 companies whose businesses are historically profitable enough that they can afford to continue higher dividend payouts year after year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VIG) is a popular ETF with a portfolio reflecting this exact index. Founded in 2006, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF strives for a mix of capital appreciation and income from dividend growth companies, i.e. those with a history of dividend increases accompanying growth. Its yield is 1.87% and it has a 0.05% expense ratio. The dividend increases have to be consistent for a minimum of 10 years to warrant inclusion. Surprisingly, the top 25% companies with the highest yields are excluded from the 330+ stocks on the VIG roster. VIG has a Morningstar gold ETF ranking. It had $101.79 billion assets under management (AUM) as of the time of this writing. A look at VIG’s top 10 holdings shows how its criteria differ from S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs, which are usually led by Magnificent 7 stocks, based on market cap size: Broadcom Microsoft Apple Eli Lilly JP Morgan Chase Visa, Inc. Exxon Mobil MasterCard Costco Wholesale Walmart The VIG Dividend Difference As the calculator demonstrates, a $15,000 investment in VIG back in January, 2020 would be worth $25,833.91 today, at the time of this writing, which equates to a 72.23% ROI. The total return would be $10,833.91. The annualized return equates to 10.62%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value is $2,425.58. The actual cash dividends paid out from the initial 119.67 shares equates to $1,849.45. If the dividends are not reinvested, the total return would be $8,408.33. Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return differential of $2,425.58 over the 5 year span. The Dividend Reinvestment Advantage For Safer Returns Dividend stocks with annual payout growth can boost capital appreciation through compounding, or provide extra income in the case of emergencies. As the charts demonstrate, reinvesting dividends contributed a 22% boost to ROI, while overall capital appreciation growth still averaged over 10% annually. Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIP) can automatically implement purchases of additional shares without additional fees or order entries, if one is so inclined. In the case of an ETF such as VIG, investors with weaker stomachs for volatility can sleep more easily, knowing that their portfolios are still growing albeit without the roller coaster ride delivered by Nvidia, for example. Another plus to VIG is that since it contains both current and potential future Dividend King and Dividend Aristocrat stocks, the dividend amounts will continue to grow with each passing year. This will, in turn, increase the amount of additional shares that can be obtained under a DRIP agreement. This is a classic compounding model for health building that can work for the benefit of many investors. On the contingency side, the investor can always cancel the DRIP agreement if there is an emergency need for the dividend income pending, since it can always be renewed at a later date after the crisis has passed.

For bearish-leaning risk takers, the SPXS ETF offers powerful leverage when the S&amp;P 500 declines. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) The first quarter of this year reminded optimistic investors that stocks don&#8217;t only go up. Trade war tensions, recession worries, and other factors could spur a market crash in 2025. Instead of using fancy strategies like short-selling stocks or buying put options, there&#8217;s an easier way that doesn&#8217;t require a margin account. Bearish-leaning investors can profit from a stock market crash of 20% or more by owning inverse exchange traded funds (ETFs). These funds are specifically designed to gain value when a stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, goes down. There are risks involved, to be sure, but the following three inverse ETFs could set you up for powerful returns if the market craters. ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (SH) The S&amp;P 500 is a commonly cited stock index that represents a broad selection of large-cap U.S.-focused companies. Therefore, a simple way to profit from a stock market crash would be to hold an inverse ETF that gains value when the S&amp;P 500 collapses. ProShares offers an ETF that serves this exact purpose. It&#8217;s a fund called the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SH), and it seeks to move inversely to the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500. What&#8217;s good about moving inversely to the S&amp;P 500 is that it&#8217;s usually a slower-moving index than the NASDAQ 100. Therefore, the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF should carry less risk than some other inverse ETFs. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 comprises a broad range of stocks from multiple market sectors. Some S&amp;P 500 component stocks include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Thus, you&#8217;re actually achieving what I call &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the SH ETF. Even with the somewhat de-risking effect of &#8220;inverse diversification,&#8221; the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF could gain value quickly if there&#8217;s a stock market crash. Be aware, though, that the SH ETF won&#8217;t necessarily move up at the exact same pace that the S&amp;P 500 goes down. That&#8217;s because the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 throughout the day but then resets and rebalances the next day. As ProShares explains, &#8220;For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target [i.e., the S&amp;P 500]. These differences may be significant.&#8221; To put it another way, you&#8217;ll get faithful inverse S&amp;P 500 tracking for a day with the SH ETF. However, the longer you hold the fund, the more the results can vary from what you might expect. Consequently, while the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF would probably make you money during a market crash, it&#8217;s not meant to be held for too long. ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) If you&#8217;re willing to accept more risk, consider that the NASDAQ 100 mostly covers only one market sector (technology) and only includes around 100 stocks (as opposed to around 500 stocks in the more diversified S&amp;P 500). So, an ETF that inversely tracks the NASDAQ 100 is somewhat riskier but could yield greater rewards in the event of a market crash. To that end, you might consider the ProShares Short QQQ ETF (NYSEARCA:PSQ). This fund inversely corresponds to the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 index. Bear in mind that the NASDAQ 100 is mainly focused on technology sector stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). You won&#8217;t get as much &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the ProShares Short QQQ ETF as you would get with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, but you could potentially achieve greater returns during a market crash with the PSQ ETF. Much like with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, the ProShares Short QQQ ETF is subject to unexpected results if you hold the fund for longer than a day. Hence, I&#8217;ll send out a similar warning: even if the stock market is collapsing, don&#8217;t hold the PSQ ETF for too long because the risks will probably increase over time. Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (SPXS) My third entry for the best inverse ETFs to profit in a market crash is the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXS). This, like the SH ETF, may be somewhat de-risked because it inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 and has &#8220;inverse diversification.&#8221; However, the SPXS ETF is still the riskiest fund on this list. What makes the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF so high-risk and potentially high-reward is that the fund is inverse and triple-leveraged. This means that the SPXS ETF, on a daily basis, moves three times as fast as the S&amp;P 500, but in the opposite direction. In theory, you might assume that the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF would go up 60% if the S&amp;P 500 goes down 20%. Again, however, there&#8217;s no assurance of faithful index tracking beyond one day. Hence, you could get highly unexpected results if you hold the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF for a long time. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s probably too risky to hold the SPXS ETF for more than a couple of weeks, even during a stock market crash. Besides, if the stock market suddenly rallies, the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF could make a triple-magnified move to the downside. The point is that the SPXS ETF is for nimble, sniper-like traders who can get into and out of a position quickly. If you prefer to take on less risk, consider the non-leveraged ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF or ProShares Short QQQ ETF.The post 3 Best Inverse ETFs to Profit in a Market Crash appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/05/22/3-best-inverse-etfs-to-profit-in-a-market-crash/

Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) The volatility of the stock market over the past three months has been a roller coaster ride that has left many with a case of nausea. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has ranged from 44,882.13 at the end of January to 40,813.57 in mid-March, plummeting lower to 37,645.59 during the first week of April, then to soar back up to 42,410 in mid-May at the time of this writing. People who lack the stomach for such rapid lows and highs often leave the market altogether or seek a less turbulent asset class, while still being able to see gains in some form or fashion. For those who find bonds too stodgy but like the idea of lower volatility with some growth and an income component, the realm of dividend stocks has long been a popular choice of institutions and retirees. 24/7 Wall Street has a sizeable database of dividend stocks and has published numerous articles on the topic that showcased different sample combinations to meet yield and sector diversity demands. For those seeking the added risk mitigation of diversification through a fund structure, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are an excellent way to access dividend stock benefits without single stock risks. For a solid high dividend yield ETF, one worth serious consideration is the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VYM). The Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF &#8211; Dividend Cash in a Decade Created 19 years ago in 2006, The Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF is Vanguard’s ETF for investors seeking to track the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. For a quick thumbnail description of VYM as of the tie of this writing: Total Assets $70.42 billion Yield 2.97% Average Daily Volume 1.51 million shares Expense Ratio 0.06% 52 Week Range 112.05-135.10 Beta 0.82 1 year returns 10.03% 3 year returns 8.26% 5 year returns 13.25% 10 year returns 9.48% Composition of the ETF: Top 5 Largest holdings: Top 5 Largest Industrial Sectors: Broadcom 4.0% Financial Services 20.61% JP Morgan Chase 3.58% Healthcare 14.71% Exxon Mobil 2.72% Technology 12.77% UnitedHealth Group 2.51% Consumer Defensive 12.58% Procter &amp; Gamble 2.09% Industrials 10.89% A $5,000 investment in VYM back in January, 2015 would be worth $12,552.82 today, as of the time of this writing, which equates to a cumulative 155.67% ROI. The total return would be $7,552.85. The annualized return equates to 9.64%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value equates to $3,379.55. The actual cash dividends paid out from the initial 71.02 shares equates to $2,049.82. If the dividends were not reinvested, the total return would be $4,173.30. Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return of $3,503.73 over a 10-year long stretch. . Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIP) Advantages and Disadvantages Reinvesting dividends in a DRIP program can accelerate wealth building though compounding and dollar cost averaging. Dividend Reinvestment plans, as the comparison shows, can be a powerful tool for wealth building through compounding. Most DRIP arrangements do not charge additional fees, and the investments are on autopilot, so they eschew the need to place additional buy orders. Of course, entering into a DRIP arrangement assumes that the investor does not need the dividend income. Additionally, there are two other things that investors need to bear in mind with DRIP arrangement: Monitoring portfolio allocation &#8211; If a portfolio is being designed to maintain a certain ratio balance between, say 75% growth and 25% income, the ratio can get skewed if the growth portion does not add shares while the income portion continues to do so over time. Stock becomes overvalued &#8211; While buying on autopilot over the long haul may be a generally good strategy, there are times when market conditions can change to the point where a security or fund can become too expensive and overvalued. In these situations, curtailing DRIP might be prudent, and profit taking might even be a consideration in those circumstances.

Buy the Rumor 1:41 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America has issued a report advising investors to buy the trade deal anticipation but sell the news. BofA Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote, &#8220;Oversold equities have correctly front-run Q2 trade deals/lower tariffs. We expect ‘buy the expectation, sell the fact,’ stocks fade into the trade deals.&#8221; The White House is expected to meet with China officials on potentially reaching a trade agreement over the weekend. Stocks remain lower out of caution. Markets Hold Back 12:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s government officials have come out swinging against the White House, saying they strongly opposes what they described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also getting a pop from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a strong Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 114.55 (+0.26%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 102.00 (+0.57%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.36 (+0.41%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but that is what it takes to trade as one of the leading tech stocks. As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is taking a breather after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire options trading platform Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal, thrusting it into the crypto derivatives realm.

As of 11:45 am: Nasdaq Composite: -1.48% S&amp;P 500: -0.74% Dow Jones Industrial Average: -.02% Shares of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) are down 1% in morning trading Wednesday after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced it would take a massive $5.5 billion writedown in the first quarter. The artificial intelligence chipmaker said in a late-afternoon SEC filing yesterday the U.S. government was imposing new trade restrictions on its H20 AI chips that would require it to get a license to export them because they could be used in or diverted to a Chinese supercomputer. Due to the inventory of H20 chips it had on hand, as well as previously agreed to purchase commitments and related reserves, it would be taking the massive writedown. Erecting new barriers Nvidia had designed the H20 specifically to get around export restrictions of its previous chip, the H800. That was the one the Chinese AI firm DeepSeek used to build its R1 large language model that caused a tumult in the market when it launched earlier this year. The chips are cheaper and less powerful than Nvidia&#8217;s latest generation Blackwell chips that sell for tens of thousands of dollars. Pricing isn&#8217;t so straightforward though as the chips won&#8217;t be sold as a standalone product. It hits especially hard because earlier this month, Nvidia stock jumped on reports that Chinese tech companies, including Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), and TikTok owner ByteDance, had ordered $16 billion worth of the H20 accelerators over the first three months of the year. Nvidia said the write off would be necessary because of the inventory of H20 chips it had on hand, purchase commitments, and related reserves. Nvidia will be reporting its fiscal 2026 first-quarter earnings results on May 26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 200 points, or 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was off almost 2%. Collateral damage The indices are also under pressure because Bloomberg reported little progress has been made between the European Union and the U.S. to resolve their trade differences. While the EU has proposed eliminating all tariffs in both directions, U.S. officials have so far rejected that because of other non-tariff restrictions U.S. goods face, including digital and AI regulations, along with various food standards. Other chipmakers on the S&amp;P 500 are falling as well, including Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) as it says it will take an $800 million hit due to tariffs. Its shares are down 6% because the new trade restrictions will affect its MI308 chips. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is down 2.2% and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is off 1.7%. The impact of tech stocks on SPY is offsetting the positive news that retail sales rose 1.4% in March, in line with expectations and well ahead of the 0.2% gain seen in February. It was the best reading in more than two years. However, it is likely sales were pulled forward into the month due to consumers buying more ahead of tariffs going into effect. That suggests retail sales in future months won&#8217;t be as strong and feeds the fear the U.S. economy is growing slower than analysts had previously predicted.

The Nasdaq Composite is leading the charge with a 1.8% advance, followed by the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which are up 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. China is apparently ready to come to the negotiating table on tariffs, infusing optimism into an otherwise confused stock market today. The Nasdaq Composite is being led by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) and Apple Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT) today. At the current pace, the Nasdaq Composite is looking at a 7% gain for the week, giving it a year-to-date advance of about 3%. Whipsaw Trading 12:18 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are seeing green as of early afternoon trading in what has been a whipsaw trading session for investors. All three of the major stock market indices are now seeing green, but there is a lack of conviction in either direction today. The Nasdaq Composite is being lifted by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Linde (Nasdaq: LIN), with gains of 3% and 2%, respectively. While the latest wholesale price data shows inflation is waning, policymakers aren&#8217;t convinced. NY Fed official John Williams predicts economic growth will slow to a mere 1% in 2025, blaming tariffs for what he expects could result in 4% inflation by year-end. Stocks Flip Green 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo As of mid-morning trading, the stock market has turned higher, with all three of the major stock market averages now seeing green. Most sectors of the economy are now trading higher, led by materials and technology, each of which are up about 1%. The economy is still uncertain, but inflation is headed in the right direction &#8211; lower. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned on CNBC that a recession might have already reared its head in the U.S. economy. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand at last check: Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 198.68 (+0.48%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 129.17 (+0.79%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.31 (+0.40%) The markets remain fearful, falling modestly at the open across the board amid what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called a turbulent economy. Dimon also warned that S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates are going to be revised downward as corporate American continues to cancel their current outlooks, some of which have already begun to do so. He expects that American banks will be in the crosshairs of the trade wars. Markets are also weighing some better than expected economic data on the inflationary front. Wholesale price declined by 0.4% last month, yet another indication of waning inflation as the Federal Reserve gears up for its May meeting on interest rates. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 305.83 (-0.77%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 78.09 (-0.44%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.54 (-0.66%) Market Movers It&#8217;s a tale of two markets for the chip stocks today. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is falling a steep 8.9% to about its 52-week low level. The stock was trading in the $200 area last month to currently hover at $142 per share. On the flip side, Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 4.3% today to nearly $94 per share. The stock was well over $100 per share in recent weeks and has been volatile. Earnings season has begun. Financial stock Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reported better-than-expected Q1 profit results, sending shares up about 1%. The company&#8217;s results were fueled by robust stock market trading, leading to a record performance in that business. Advertising technology company AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) shares are under pressure today, falling 6% to below $250 per share as the tug-of-war in that stock continues to unfold. Bitcoin bull MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is rising 5% on the day alongside a rising BTC price.

This rebound follows China&#8217;s imposition of 125% tariffs on U.S. products, contributing to persistent uncertainty after a turbulent week sparked by U.S. tariff announcements. The stock market is shrugging off the latest salvo between the U.S. and China over trade. All stock indices opened slightly higher at the morning bell, with the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) up 0.7%. China raised its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the rate President Trump had imposed on Chinese imports. Beijing, though, said it no longer matters what further increases the U.S. hits it with as it will not respond because &#8220;Given that, at the current tariff level, U.S. exports to China are no longer commercially viable, China will not respond to any further tariff hikes by the U.S. on Chinese goods.&#8221; With Trump having essentially eliminated the de minimis rule that Chinese marketplaces like Temu and Schein used to ship cheap goods to the U.S. duty-free, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to say trade between the U.S. and China is dead. Big names bolster market Although most components of the Vanguard ETF are down, the biggest components of the index are moving higher. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), representing the second largest position in the exchange-traded fund at over 6%, is up more than 2%, helping to drive the ETF higher. Even though top dog Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the red, it is almost at break-even so its impact is negligible. Yet some components are up strongly in morning trading. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which is the eighth largest position, is up 3.4%. The AI chipmaker&#8217;s stock has held up better than most over the tumultuous week with shares 22% higher. Banking on trading turmoil What is buoying stocks this morning are the results of bank stock earnings starting to come in with giants like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported record revenue on higher trading despite caution over economic headwinds. JPM stock represents 1.5% of VOO&#8217;s portfolio, just behind 10th place Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at 1.6%. JPMorgan is up 2% in morning trading. Other financial stocks in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF that reported earnings today include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), both of which had better than expected results. Yet banks were also being very cautious and were setting aside larger amounts for credit losses. It suggests they foresee tougher times coming and are preparing for the worst. JPMorgan&#8217;s provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter rose to $3.3 billion from $2.6 billion. Wells Fargo&#8217;s provision, however, was lower than expected. It set aside $932 million, less than the $1.2 billion Wall Street wass anticipating. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit loss provision was just $135 million, but it is markedly higher than the $6 million et aside in its year-ago first quarter.

Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), AKA TSMC, plans to drastically increase its investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, including new fabrication plants and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) holds a crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, commanding over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. Its ability to deliver cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities is essential for customers developing artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and other advanced technologies. Therefore, we see a more than 46% gain for the stock by the end of the decade. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. The stock hit an all-time high of $226.40 earlier this year but has been in retreat since then. In fact, the share price is 8.3% lower than at the start of the year. It is up 28.9% year over year, though, outperforming the broader markets in that time. Wall Street remains optimistic, and analysts see plenty of room for the stock to run, at least in the short term. Investors are of course concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it is clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall St. aims to present some farther-looking insights based on TSMC’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help with your own research. All Roads Lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to TSMC, the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) designs a new chip, it takes it to TSMC to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. TSMC is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, TSMC commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, TSMC has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. TSMC does face certain challenges, including: Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. The Leadership of the People’s Republic of China claims that Taiwan is a part of China proper. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil likely would result in a domino-effect of chip shortages. TSMC had raised prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, TSMC has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSMC will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. TSMC&#8217;s Performance The company experienced significant growth and transformation from 2014 to 2024, in that time solidifying its position as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. 2014 was the year that the TSMC-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSMC for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw TSMC prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, Arizona, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSMC signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan&#8217;s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world&#8217;s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSMC form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) is a primary driver for TSMC, but its future growth is also heavily tied to strategic partnerships, geopolitical considerations, and the following: Technological Leadership: TSMC&#8217;s ongoing advancement in process technology, particularly in nodes like 3nm and beyond, allows them to command premium pricing and maintain a strong market share. The company&#8217;s ability to deliver cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities is essential for customers developing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and advanced mobile devices. Demand from Key Sectors: The increasing demand for semiconductors in crucial fields like AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and 5G and advanced mobile devices. While the surge in AI applications drives a need for the powerful chips TSMC manufactures, data centers and other HPC applications also require high-end semiconductors. Furthermore, the evolution of 5G and the increasing sophistication of mobile devices contribute significantly to TSMC&#8217;s revenue. Supply Chain Dynamics: The importance of robust semiconductor supply chains is undeniable, and TSMC&#8217;s role in that chain is very crucial. This serves as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Because of its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, TSMC can easily scale for demand acceleration, and it holds close to a near monopoly on large graphics processing unit (GPU) chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 TSMC’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. The consensus recommendation for TSMC stock from 17 Wall Street analysts is to buy shares. Three of those analysts have Strong Buy ratings. Their average price target in 12 months is $247.07, which is 37.5% above the current price. 24/7 Wall St.’s 12-month projection for TSMC’s price is $183.92 a share, which signals a gain of 2.4% in the coming year. While the company is set to start its 2-nm process this year, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we do not anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Outlook for the Next 5 Years Since TSMC consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a 5.8% year-over-year retreat. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSMC competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall St. price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of TSMC’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare, and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. U.S. and German TSMC factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. By 2030, TSMC&#8217;s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a more than 46% gain over today&#8217;s stock price.

All on news it just acquired Ambry Genetics, a well-known leader in genetic testing, for $600 million, which included $375 million in cash payments and $225 million in shares. Key Points About Article Just a few weeks ago, Tempus AI (NASDAQ: TEM) rocketed from about 44% higher. All on news it just acquired Ambry Genetics and on news, Nancy Pelosi took a stake in the TEM stock by buying 50 of the TEM January 2026 $20 call options. Tempus AI CFO Jim Rogers just sold over 31,000 shares, removing about $2.6 million of value from the stock. However, we wouldn’t read too much into the selling.

Tempus AI CFO Jim Rogers just sold over 31,000 shares, removing about $2.6 million of value from the stock. However, we wouldn’t read too much into the selling. For us, it’s not a significant cause for concern because the funds could be used for personal reasons. We also have to remember that Tempus AI is moving to revolutionize healthcare with artificial intelligence. Plus, the Ambry Genetics acquisition “complements our strategy of leveraging diagnostics and data to drive innovation, further strengthening our ability to deliver cutting-edge solutions to clinicians, patients, and life sciences companies,” says CEO Eric Lefkofsky. The acquisition is also expected to strengthen Tempus AI’s product offerings and accelerate its road to positive free cash flow and profitability.

AVGO,2024-12-27 04:30:39,Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241227.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

Taiwan Semiconductor News and Updates 12/20/2024 The Biden administration is planning to blacklist Sophgo, a Chinese company illegally using a Taiwan Semiconductor chip in a Huawei AI processor. The chip, which was found in Huawei’s Ascend 910B, matched one ordered by Sophgo from TSMC. 12/18/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s Arizona-based chip fabrication plant is almost back on schedule according to the company’s Chairman, Rick Cassidy. The Arizona plant is the most advanced chip fabrication facility in the United States, producing 4-nanometer chips. 12/16/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price experienced a slight increase of 0.1% today, trading as high as $205.50. However, trading volume was lower than average, with only 5.8 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price dipped 0.5% today, trading as low as $192.21. 12/11/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor has released a new report illustrating a solid financial performance for November 2024. The company’s revenue for the month reached NT$276.06 billion, marking a 34% year-over-year increase. 12/9/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price declined slightly today, trading as low as $199.16. The stock traded lower than its previous closing price, with a significantly lower than average trading volume. 12/6/2024 Nvidia’s stock price experienced a slight decline of 0.4% to $144.48 in early Friday trading. However, for the week, the stock has seen a 4.8% increase. 12/5/2024 Tawaian Semiconductor may soon be making Nvidia’s powerful new Blackwell AI chips. Production on the chips could begin as early as next year at TSMC’s new factory in Arizona, which is currently under construction. Currently, the chips are manufactured in Taiwan at TSMC’s main plants. However, while the initial stages of production can occur in Arizona, the chips would still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for final packaging. 11/27/2024 Taiwan Semiconducter’s large investment in U.S. manufacturing was a strategic move to diversify its operations and address geopolitical tensions. However, experts suggest that the advanced chip production capabilities in the U.S. may lag behind those in Taiwan for some time. 11/26/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor experienced a slight decline of 0.1% in its share price today, trading as low as $183.87. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 2.16% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is -10.86% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 23.39% gain over today’s stock price.

AVGO,2024-12-26 04:25:03,Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241226.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

Taiwan Semiconductor News and Updates 12/20/2024 The Biden administration is planning to blacklist Sophgo, a Chinese company illegally using a Taiwan Semiconductor chip in a Huawei AI processor. The chip, which was found in Huawei’s Ascend 910B, matched one ordered by Sophgo from TSMC. 12/18/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s Arizona-based chip fabrication plant is almost back on schedule according to the company’s Chairman, Rick Cassidy. The Arizona plant is the most advanced chip fabrication facility in the United States, producing 4-nanometer chips. 12/16/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price experienced a slight increase of 0.1% today, trading as high as $205.50. However, trading volume was lower than average, with only 5.8 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price dipped 0.5% today, trading as low as $192.21. 12/11/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor has released a new report illustrating a solid financial performance for November 2024. The company’s revenue for the month reached NT$276.06 billion, marking a 34% year-over-year increase. 12/9/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price declined slightly today, trading as low as $199.16. The stock traded lower than its previous closing price, with a significantly lower than average trading volume. 12/6/2024 Nvidia’s stock price experienced a slight decline of 0.4% to $144.48 in early Friday trading. However, for the week, the stock has seen a 4.8% increase. 12/5/2024 Tawaian Semiconductor may soon be making Nvidia’s powerful new Blackwell AI chips. Production on the chips could begin as early as next year at TSMC’s new factory in Arizona, which is currently under construction. Currently, the chips are manufactured in Taiwan at TSMC’s main plants. However, while the initial stages of production can occur in Arizona, the chips would still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for final packaging. 11/27/2024 Taiwan Semiconducter’s large investment in U.S. manufacturing was a strategic move to diversify its operations and address geopolitical tensions. However, experts suggest that the advanced chip production capabilities in the U.S. may lag behind those in Taiwan for some time. 11/26/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor experienced a slight decline of 0.1% in its share price today, trading as low as $183.87. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 1.39% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is -11.53% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 22.46% gain over today’s stock price.

The Lady Grey gold prospect is adjacent to the historic Bounty Gold Mine which produced some 1.3 million ounces of gold on Covalent Lithium’s Mount Holland mine site. This is the second phase of the drilling program, testing the modelled conductor plate under modelled moving loop EM (MLEM) survey line #6. The modelled conductor plate under MLEM Line #6 is 200 metres below surface and dips to the east, and is being drilled from the existing historical access road which links the old Lady Ada mine and the Marvel Loch Forrestania Road. Drill testing will consist of the three reverse circulation (RC) precollars, previously completed to a maximum of 150 metres, with diamond tail drill holes as seen here: Modelled Conductor Plate (in Red) with Drill Holes Traces (in Blue) superimposed on Google Earth image and cross section below. Drilling of the first diamond tail into the MLEM conductor plate under EM line #6 is now underway. “Once again we are really excited to finally get the diamond bit spinning on the diamond tails testing the modelled EM conductor plate under Line #6 which coincides with a 75ppb Ultrafine (UFF) soil gold anomaly,” Lanthanein technical director Brian Thomas said. “We continue to liaise with DEMIRS on the PoW to enable drill testing of the much higher ranking EM conductor plate under Line #1 which coincides with the 256 ppb gold UFF soil anomaly with the flora and fauna survey report lodged with DEMIRS and the on ground heritage survey by Ballardong Aboriginal Corporation and their heritage consultants now complete.” Traditional Owners from the Ballardong Aboriginal Corporation with the assistance of their heritage consultants have carried out the on-ground heritage avoidance survey for MLEM Line #1 access track and drill line.

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO, ETR:1YD) shares jumped to a record high in after-hours trading on Thursday after the chipmaker reported record-breaking results driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The company posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $14.1 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.42 and EBITDA of $9.09 billion both exceeded expectations. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan highlighted the significant role AI played in the company’s growth. “Semiconductor revenue was a record $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion,” Tan said. “AI revenue grew 220% year-on-year, fueled by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.” For the fiscal year, Broadcom reported total revenue of $51.6 billion, up 44% year-on-year, with infrastructure software revenue soaring to $21.5 billion, thanks to the successful integration of VMware. Net income climbed to $4.32 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $3.52 billion a year earlier. The company also announced a robust 11% dividend increase, raising its annualized payout to $2.36 per share, underscoring its confidence in sustained growth. Broadcom provided upbeat guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, forecasting revenue of $14.6 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $14.55 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be 66% of revenue. “Continued strong AI demand momentum and synergies from VMware integration will drive our performance in the coming quarters,” said CFO Kirsten Spears. The explosive growth in AI revenue reflects Broadcom’s strategic focus on next-generation technology, including AI accelerators and networking solutions. These advancements are central to the company’s competitive edge in the semiconductor market, which supplies major tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC).",https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1062752/lanthanein-resources-diamond-drill-bit-spinning-at-mt-holland-s-lady-grey-gold-prospect-1062752.html

The company had strong support from shareholders to complete this important capital raise, positioning the company for another great year in 2025. “We expect to build off of our recently released PFS to materially advance the redevelopment of the Nifty Copper Complex in the first half of the year.” This included Flat Footed LLC (FF) which agreed to cornerstone the placement in the amount of A$5.3 million, in exchange for 20 million additional unlisted options, subject to shareholder approval. Directors of the company, or their nominees, have also committed to subscribe for placement shares in the aggregate amount of A$3.0 million. FF’s commitment and the directors’ participation will be subject to shareholder approval, to be sought at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in January. At the completion of the placement, FF stands to hold some 19% of the company’s fully paid ordinary shares. FF’s participation also remains subject to renewal of a previously obtained FIRB approval, which is expected in early 2025. Cyprium plans to channel proceeds from the placement into a range of operational and financial purposes, including: Additionally, funds will be allocated to working capital and covering the costs associated with the placement itself. The A$13.5 million will be raised using a two-tranche placement. Tranche 1 will raise around A$5.2 million under Cyprium’s existing placement capacity as per ASX Listing Rules 7.1 and 7.1A. Tranche 2 aims to raise about A$8.3 million, subject to shareholder approval, which includes participation from cornerstone investor Freeport Financial (FF) and company directors. The issue price for the placement shares is A$0.028 per share, a 3.7% premium to the last closing price of A$0.027 on December 10 and a 6.7% premium to the five-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) of A$0.026. Subscribers will also receive one unlisted option for every two shares purchased, with an exercise price of A$0.042 and an expiry date of December 31, 2027. Canaccord Genuity (TSX:CF, LSE:CF) acted as lead manager to the placement. The company also intends to undertake a non-renounceable retail entitlement offer to raise up to A$3.0 million on the same terms as the placement, including the placement options. The company is advanced in finalising the documentation for this offer and intends to make a further announcement next week. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO, ETR:1YD) shares jumped to a record high in after-hours trading on Thursday after the chipmaker reported record-breaking results driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The company posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $14.1 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.42 and EBITDA of $9.09 billion both exceeded expectations. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan highlighted the significant role AI played in the company’s growth. “Semiconductor revenue was a record $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion,” Tan said. “AI revenue grew 220% year-on-year, fueled by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.” For the fiscal year, Broadcom reported total revenue of $51.6 billion, up 44% year-on-year, with infrastructure software revenue soaring to $21.5 billion, thanks to the successful integration of VMware. Net income climbed to $4.32 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $3.52 billion a year earlier. The company also announced a robust 11% dividend increase, raising its annualized payout to $2.36 per share, underscoring its confidence in sustained growth. Broadcom provided upbeat guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, forecasting revenue of $14.6 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $14.55 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be 66% of revenue. “Continued strong AI demand momentum and synergies from VMware integration will drive our performance in the coming quarters,” said CFO Kirsten Spears. The explosive growth in AI revenue reflects Broadcom’s strategic focus on next-generation technology, including AI accelerators and networking solutions. These advancements are central to the company’s competitive edge in the semiconductor market, which supplies major tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC).",https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1062750/cyprium-metals-to-target-funds-of-around-a-13-5-million-in-two-tranche-placement-for-nifty-copper-complex-1062750.html

As the drive towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our everyday lives progresses, there are a handful of mega-cap companies that are capable of meeting that demand. And as much NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) may get the lion’s share of attention, it is companies like Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) that will also be playing a central role in supply. The San Jose, Calif.-based company, which was founded in 1961, has been a major player in the tech space for decades. But its business sectors focusing on semiconductors and infrastructure software products have been major catalysts in its market cap pushing toward $1 trillion market capitalization — good for a top 15 among all publicly traded companies. Despite shares of Broadcom gaining over 664.42% in the past five years and 47.15% in 2024, 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside for Broadcom before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect the stock to be over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Broadcom’s history of stellar earnings and strong revenue generation suggests the ability of the company to remain one of the most appealing semiconductor and software stocks. With the burgeoning AI trend and a recent stock split, Broadcom is increasingly appealing and more accessible to investors.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Recent Broadcom News and Updates 12/11/2024 Apple and Broadcom are reportedly collaborating to develop a specialized AI chip for servers. This news has lead to a boost in Broadcom’s stock price today. The partnership will allow Broadcom to gain a stronger foothold in the AI chip market, which is currently dominated by Nvidia. 12/9/2024 Broadcom is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 earnings this Thursday. Analysts are anticipating strong results from the company. JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur remains bullish, maintaining an “Overweight” rating with a $210 price target. Sur also forecasts that Broadcom’s revenue and earnings will surpass both JP Morgan’s and consensus estimates. The firm expects revenue to range between $14.2 billion and $14.3 billion and an adjusted EPS of $1.40. 12/6/2024 Broadcom is returning 1,500 of its 2,000 largest customers to channel partners. The company hopes this will ensure partners offer better deals to customers and prevent further customer losses to VMware. 12/5/2024 Broadcom recently revealed its 3.5D XDSiP platform, a major breakthrough in chip technology. The new platform is specifically tailored to meet the soaring demand for computational power in AI by integrating a massive 6000 mm² of silicon and up to 12 HBM stacks into a single package. This translates to increased computational power, reduced latency, lower power consumption, a smaller footprint, faster time-to-market, and better support for diverse AI workloads. 12/3/2024 Broadcom shares had a slight uptick today, rising 0.4% and reaching a high of $168.20. 11/27/2024 Samsung and Broadcom have reached a settlement in the antitrust lawsuit filed by Samsung against Broadcom. The lawsuit alleged that Broadcom engaged in anticompetitive practices by tying the sale of certain components to the purchase of others, effectively preventing Samsung from switching to alternative suppliers. 11/26/2024 Broadcom saw a modest increase of 0.6% in its share price today, reaching a high of $166.37. Trading volume was much lower than average, however, with only 4.4 million shares exchanging hands (an 85% decrease from the usual daily volume). 11/22/2024 Broadcom’s stock price decreased 0.8% today, trading as low as $162.42. 11/21/2024 Broadcom’s stock price increased 0.2% today, trading as high as $166.34. 11/19/2024 Broadcom investors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report tomorrow, as it is poised to significantly impact the broader market, particularly companies like Broadcom, which supplies crucial components for Nvidia’s AI operations. A strong earnings report from Nvidia could boost investor confidence in AI growth and Broadcom’s stocks, as seen on several previous occasions. Broadcom’s Recent Stock Success Broadcom’s incredible growth has been reflected in the price of its shares, which have surged since 2014 to the tune of a 3,170% gain. This culminated on July 15, 2024, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split that made its shares more accessible to all investors by driving the stock’s price down to $167 at the time. Beyond its role in AI and semiconductors, Broadcom is also a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), providing the Magnificent Seven mainstay with critical wireless connectivity components and other hardware. According to the company, Broadcom expects 20% growth in wireless revenue just in the final quarter of 2024. Between its semiconductor, software and smartphone business segments, the stock has experienced sizable growth in the recent past: INSERT TABLE HERE Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $10.06 $4.244 $1.343 2015 $14.63 $6.897 $2.613 2016 $18.19 $13.269 $4.672 2017 $25.69 $17.656 $7.255 2018 $25.36 $20.805 $9.391 2019 $31.65 $22.548 $9.452 2020 $43.79 $23.858 $9.993 2021 $66.48 $27.403 $12.578 2022 $55.24 $33.169 $16.526 2023 $111.63 $35.798 $18.378 *Post-split adjusted basis , **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, Broadcom’s revenue grew by more than 743% while its net income increased by over 1,268%.

As the Silicon Valley mainstay looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact Broadcom’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of Broadcom’s Stock Performance 1. Exceptional Track Record of Earnings and Revenue Beats: Going back to the first quarter of 2015, Broadcom has beaten earnings in every single quarter except one. That is one earnings miss over the course of 39 quarters. Expectations are that the company will continue to beat on earnings and revenue, with a forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 for the last quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company posted an impressive 17.65% year-over-year EPS gain, which year-over-year total revenue grew from $8.88 billion in July 2023 to $13.07 billion in July 2024 — an increase of 47.18%. 2. Filling the Gap NVIDIA Cannot Satisfy: For investors concerned about NVIDIA’s possible overvaluation or the company’s inability to single-handedly satisfy the explosive AI-driven semiconductor demand, Broadcom is an alternative that at current prices could be considered a bargain. In September, Barchart.com reported that the “stock looks deeply undervalued … based on its strong revenue, free cash flow, FCF margin, management guidance and analysts’ price targets.” Specifically, that free cash flow has grown markedly between FY 2019 to FY 2023, from $9.27 billion to $17.63 billion good for an increase of over 90%. As demand for semiconductors and microchips continues to grow, Broadcom has an abundance of cash ready to be deployed in order to match that growth. 3. Institutional Ownership: Broadcom is beloved by institutional investors, of which there are 3,382. Of the company’s 4.671 billion shares outstanding, a staggering 3.537 billion of them are held by institutional investors, according to Nasdaq.com. That accounts for 75.74% of the company’s entire stock. The top three largest holders are Vanguard Group with 448 million shares followed by BlackRock at 342 million and Capital World Investors with 224 million shares. Together, those three positions account for $175.432 million in share value. And in the past year, 1,760 institutional investors increased their positions. Broadcom (AVGO) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Broadcom is $195, representing a potential upside of 13.50% over the next 12 months. Of all the analysts covering Broadcom, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.43 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for AVGO shares is $204.27, representing a 18.90% potential upside based on an EPS of $6.19 and a PE ratio of 33.

As the drive towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our everyday lives progresses, there are a handful of mega-cap companies that are capable of meeting that demand. And as much NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) may get the lion’s share of attention, it is companies like Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) that will also be playing a central role in supply. The San Jose, Calif.-based company, which was founded in 1961, has been a major player in the tech space for decades. But its business sectors focusing on semiconductors and infrastructure software products have been major catalysts in its market cap pushing toward $1 trillion market capitalization — good for a top 15 among all publicly traded companies. Despite shares of Broadcom gaining over 696.15% in the past five years and 53.25% in 2024, 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside for Broadcom before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect the stock to be over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Broadcom’s history of stellar earnings and strong revenue generation suggests the ability of the company to remain one of the most appealing semiconductor and software stocks. With the burgeoning AI trend and a recent stock split, Broadcom is increasingly appealing and more accessible to investors.

Recent Broadcom News and Updates 12/9/2024 Broadcom is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 earnings this Thursday. Analysts are anticipating strong results from the company. JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur remains bullish, maintaining an “Overweight” rating with a $210 price target. Sur also forecasts that Broadcom’s revenue and earnings will surpass both JP Morgan’s and consensus estimates. The firm expects revenue to range between $14.2 billion and $14.3 billion and an adjusted EPS of $1.40. 12/6/2024 Broadcom is returning 1,500 of its 2,000 largest customers to channel partners. The company hopes this will ensure partners offer better deals to customers and prevent further customer losses to VMware. 12/5/2024 Broadcom recently revealed its 3.5D XDSiP platform, a major breakthrough in chip technology. The new platform is specifically tailored to meet the soaring demand for computational power in AI by integrating a massive 6000 mm² of silicon and up to 12 HBM stacks into a single package. This translates to increased computational power, reduced latency, lower power consumption, a smaller footprint, faster time-to-market, and better support for diverse AI workloads. 12/3/2024 Broadcom shares had a slight uptick today, rising 0.4% and reaching a high of $168.20. 11/27/2024 Samsung and Broadcom have reached a settlement in the antitrust lawsuit filed by Samsung against Broadcom. The lawsuit alleged that Broadcom engaged in anticompetitive practices by tying the sale of certain components to the purchase of others, effectively preventing Samsung from switching to alternative suppliers. 11/26/2024 Broadcom saw a modest increase of 0.6% in its share price today, reaching a high of $166.37. Trading volume was much lower than average, however, with only 4.4 million shares exchanging hands (an 85% decrease from the usual daily volume). 11/22/2024 Broadcom’s stock price decreased 0.8% today, trading as low as $162.42. 11/21/2024 Broadcom’s stock price increased 0.2% today, trading as high as $166.34. 11/19/2024 Broadcom investors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report tomorrow, as it is poised to significantly impact the broader market, particularly companies like Broadcom, which supplies crucial components for Nvidia’s AI operations. A strong earnings report from Nvidia could boost investor confidence in AI growth and Broadcom’s stocks, as seen on several previous occasions. 11/18/2024 Broadcom experienced a small decline of 0.1% today, trading as low as $162.22. Trading volume was also much lower than average, with only 2,960,294 shares changing hands, a 90% decrease from the usual daily volume. Broadcom’s Recent Stock Success Broadcom’s incredible growth has been reflected in the price of its shares, which have surged since 2014 to the tune of a 3,170% gain. This culminated on July 15, 2024, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split that made its shares more accessible to all investors by driving the stock’s price down to $167 at the time. Beyond its role in AI and semiconductors, Broadcom is also a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), providing the Magnificent Seven mainstay with critical wireless connectivity components and other hardware. According to the company, Broadcom expects 20% growth in wireless revenue just in the final quarter of 2024.

AVGO,2024-12-11 03:58:48,Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241211.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

Taiwan Semiconductor News and Updates 12/9/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock price declined slightly today, trading as low as $199.16. The stock traded lower than its previous closing price, with a significantly lower than average trading volume. 12/6/2024 Nvidia’s stock price experienced a slight decline of 0.4% to $144.48 in early Friday trading. However, for the week, the stock has seen a 4.8% increase. 12/5/2024 Tawaian Semiconductor may soon be making Nvidia’s powerful new Blackwell AI chips. Production on the chips could begin as early as next year at TSMC’s new factory in Arizona, which is currently under construction. Currently, the chips are manufactured in Taiwan at TSMC’s main plants. However, while the initial stages of production can occur in Arizona, the chips would still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for final packaging. 11/27/2024 Taiwan Semiconducter’s large investment in U.S. manufacturing was a strategic move to diversify its operations and address geopolitical tensions. However, experts suggest that the advanced chip production capabilities in the U.S. may lag behind those in Taiwan for some time. 11/26/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor experienced a slight decline of 0.1% in its share price today, trading as low as $183.87. 11/25/2024 Advanced Micro Devices is looking to break into the smartphone market by teaming up with Tawain Semiconductor.

This increase follows Barclays recently raised price target for the company, an increase from $215 to $240 while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 5.82% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is -7.67% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 27.81% gain over today’s stock price.

AVGO,2024-11-26 04:30:39,Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241126.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

Taiwan Semiconductor News and Updates 11/25/2024 Advanced Micro Devices is looking to break into the smartphone market by teaming up with Tawain Semiconductor. Advanced Micro Devices will utilize cutting-edge APUs built on Tawain Semiconductor’s 3nm process. 11/22/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s stock decreased 0.1% today, trading as low as $190.17. 11/21/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s share price decreased 0.4% today, trading as low as $186.74. 11/20/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor’s share price declined by 2% today, trading between $184.06 and $185.88. 11/19/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor saw a 0.8% increase in its stock price today. This increase follows Barclays recently raised price target for the company, an increase from $215 to $240 while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. 11/18/2024 The U.S. Commerce Department has finalized a $6.6 billion subsidy for Taiwan Semiconductor to boost semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona. This marks the first major award under the $52.7 billion CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 10.70% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is -3.41% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 33.70% gain over today’s stock price.

As the drive towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our everyday lives progresses, there are a handful of mega-cap companies that are capable of meeting that demand. And as much NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) may get the lion’s share of attention, it is companies like Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) that will also be playing a central role in supply. The San Jose, Calif.-based company, which was founded in 1961, has been a major player in the tech space for decades. But its business sectors focusing on semiconductors and infrastructure software products have been major catalysts in its market cap pushing toward $1 trillion market capitalization — good for a top 15 among all publicly traded companies. Despite shares of Broadcom gaining over 633.41% in the past five years and 41.18% in 2024, 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside for Broadcom before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect the stock to be over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Broadcom’s history of stellar earnings and strong revenue generation suggests the ability of the company to remain one of the most appealing semiconductor and software stocks. With the burgeoning AI trend and a recent stock split, Broadcom is increasingly appealing and more accessible to investors.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Recent Broadcom News and Updates 11/18/2024 Broadcom experienced a small decline of 0.1% today, trading as low as $162.22. Trading volume was also much lower than average, with only 2,960,294 shares changing hands, a 90% decrease from the usual daily volume. Broadcom’s Recent Stock Success Broadcom’s incredible growth has been reflected in the price of its shares, which have surged since 2014 to the tune of a 3,170% gain. This culminated on July 15, 2024, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split that made its shares more accessible to all investors by driving the stock’s price down to $167 at the time. Beyond its role in AI and semiconductors, Broadcom is also a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), providing the Magnificent Seven mainstay with critical wireless connectivity components and other hardware. According to the company, Broadcom expects 20% growth in wireless revenue just in the final quarter of 2024. Between its semiconductor, software and smartphone business segments, the stock has experienced sizable growth in the recent past: INSERT TABLE HERE Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $10.06 $4.244 $1.343 2015 $14.63 $6.897 $2.613 2016 $18.19 $13.269 $4.672 2017 $25.69 $17.656 $7.255 2018 $25.36 $20.805 $9.391 2019 $31.65 $22.548 $9.452 2020 $43.79 $23.858 $9.993 2021 $66.48 $27.403 $12.578 2022 $55.24 $33.169 $16.526 2023 $111.63 $35.798 $18.378 *Post-split adjusted basis , **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, Broadcom’s revenue grew by more than 743% while its net income increased by over 1,268%. Despite a slight contraction in share price in 2022 during an extended bull market that had an outsized impact on the tech sector, on a post-split adjusted basis, shares of Broadcom have climbed 1,009.64% from 2014 through 2023. As the Silicon Valley mainstay looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact Broadcom’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of Broadcom’s Stock Performance 1. Exceptional Track Record of Earnings and Revenue Beats: Going back to the first quarter of 2015, Broadcom has beaten earnings in every single quarter except one. That is one earnings miss over the course of 39 quarters. Expectations are that the company will continue to beat on earnings and revenue, with a forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 for the last quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company posted an impressive 17.65% year-over-year EPS gain, which year-over-year total revenue grew from $8.88 billion in July 2023 to $13.07 billion in July 2024 — an increase of 47.18%. 2. Filling the Gap NVIDIA Cannot Satisfy: For investors concerned about NVIDIA’s possible overvaluation or the company’s inability to single-handedly satisfy the explosive AI-driven semiconductor demand, Broadcom is an alternative that at current prices could be considered a bargain. In September, Barchart.com reported that the “stock looks deeply undervalued … based on its strong revenue, free cash flow, FCF margin, management guidance and analysts’ price targets.” Specifically, that free cash flow has grown markedly between FY 2019 to FY 2023, from $9.27 billion to $17.63 billion good for an increase of over 90%. As demand for semiconductors and microchips continues to grow, Broadcom has an abundance of cash ready to be deployed in order to match that growth. 3. Institutional Ownership: Broadcom is beloved by institutional investors, of which there are 3,382. Of the company’s 4.671 billion shares outstanding, a staggering 3.537 billion of them are held by institutional investors, according to Nasdaq.com. That accounts for 75.74% of the company’s entire stock. The top three largest holders are Vanguard Group with 448 million shares followed by BlackRock at 342 million and Capital World Investors with 224 million shares. Together, those three positions account for $175.432 million in share value. And in the past year, 1,760 institutional investors increased their positions. Broadcom (AVGO) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Broadcom is $195, representing a potential upside of 17.73% over the next 12 months. Of all the analysts covering Broadcom, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.43 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for AVGO shares is $204.27, representing a 23.33% potential upside based on an EPS of $6.19 and a PE ratio of 33.

The following year, we estimate earnings per share of $7.29 on over $67 billion in revenue. Starting in 2027 through 2029, we expect a 13% growth in revenue and a 40% jump in earnings per share, bringing Broadcom’s price target from $238.14 in 2027 to $373.13 in 2029. Broadcom’s Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates Broadcom’s stock will trade at $429.09, representing a 159.07% increase from its current price, based on revenue of $86.618 billion and an EPS of $18.66.

AVGO,2024-11-19 04:01:43,Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241119.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

Tawain Semiconductor News and Updates 11/18/2024 The U.S. Commerce Department has finalized a $6.6 billion subsidy for Tawain Semiconductor to boost semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona. This marks the first major award under the $52.7 billion CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 12.72% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is –=1.65% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 36.14% gain over today’s stock price.

As the drive towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our everyday lives progresses, there are a handful of mega-cap companies that are capable of meeting that demand. And as much NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) may get the lion’s share of attention, it is companies like Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) that will also be playing a central role in supply. The San Jose, Calif.-based company, which was founded in 1961, has been a major player in the tech space for decades. But its business sectors focusing on semiconductors and infrastructure software products have been major catalysts in its market cap pushing toward $1 trillion market capitalization — good for a top 15 among all publicly traded companies. Despite shares of Broadcom gaining over 672.30% in the past five years and 48.66% in 2024, 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside for Broadcom before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect the stock to be over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Broadcom’s history of stellar earnings and strong revenue generation suggests the ability of the company to remain one of the most appealing semiconductor and software stocks. With the burgeoning AI trend and a recent stock split, Broadcom is increasingly appealing and more accessible to investors.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Broadcom’s Recent Stock Success Broadcom’s incredible growth has been reflected in the price of its shares, which have surged since 2014 to the tune of a 3,170% gain. This culminated on July 15, 2024, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split that made its shares more accessible to all investors by driving the stock’s price down to $167 at the time. Beyond its role in AI and semiconductors, Broadcom is also a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), providing the Magnificent Seven mainstay with critical wireless connectivity components and other hardware. According to the company, Broadcom expects 20% growth in wireless revenue just in the final quarter of 2024. Between its semiconductor, software and smartphone business segments, the stock has experienced sizable growth in the recent past: INSERT TABLE HERE Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $10.06 $4.244 $1.343 2015 $14.63 $6.897 $2.613 2016 $18.19 $13.269 $4.672 2017 $25.69 $17.656 $7.255 2018 $25.36 $20.805 $9.391 2019 $31.65 $22.548 $9.452 2020 $43.79 $23.858 $9.993 2021 $66.48 $27.403 $12.578 2022 $55.24 $33.169 $16.526 2023 $111.63 $35.798 $18.378 *Post-split adjusted basis , **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, Broadcom’s revenue grew by more than 743% while its net income increased by over 1,268%. Despite a slight contraction in share price in 2022 during an extended bull market that had an outsized impact on the tech sector, on a post-split adjusted basis, shares of Broadcom have climbed 1,009.64% from 2014 through 2023. As the Silicon Valley mainstay looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact Broadcom’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of Broadcom’s Stock Performance 1. Exceptional Track Record of Earnings and Revenue Beats: Going back to the first quarter of 2015, Broadcom has beaten earnings in every single quarter except one. That is one earnings miss over the course of 39 quarters. Expectations are that the company will continue to beat on earnings and revenue, with a forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 for the last quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company posted an impressive 17.65% year-over-year EPS gain, which year-over-year total revenue grew from $8.88 billion in July 2023 to $13.07 billion in July 2024 — an increase of 47.18%. 2. Filling the Gap NVIDIA Cannot Satisfy: For investors concerned about NVIDIA’s possible overvaluation or the company’s inability to single-handedly satisfy the explosive AI-driven semiconductor demand, Broadcom is an alternative that at current prices could be considered a bargain. In September, Barchart.com reported that the “stock looks deeply undervalued … based on its strong revenue, free cash flow, FCF margin, management guidance and analysts’ price targets.” Specifically, that free cash flow has grown markedly between FY 2019 to FY 2023, from $9.27 billion to $17.63 billion good for an increase of over 90%. As demand for semiconductors and microchips continues to grow, Broadcom has an abundance of cash ready to be deployed in order to match that growth. 3. Institutional Ownership: Broadcom is beloved by institutional investors, of which there are 3,382. Of the company’s 4.671 billion shares outstanding, a staggering 3.537 billion of them are held by institutional investors, according to Nasdaq.com. That accounts for 75.74% of the company’s entire stock. The top three largest holders are Vanguard Group with 448 million shares followed by BlackRock at 342 million and Capital World Investors with 224 million shares. Together, those three positions account for $175.432 million in share value. And in the past year, 1,760 institutional investors increased their positions. Broadcom (AVGO) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Broadcom is $195, representing a potential upside of 12.22% over the next 12 months. Of all the analysts covering Broadcom, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.43 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for AVGO shares is $204.27, representing a 17.55% potential upside based on an EPS of $6.19 and a PE ratio of 33.

AVGO,2024-11-14 23:19:47,Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Price Prediction and Forecast,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241114.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 12.66% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is -1.70% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 36.07% gain over today’s stock price.
