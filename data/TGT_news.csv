Make it make you money. It can make you a good deal of consistent money if you invest wisely in higher-yielding Dividend King stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Put your money to work and make it make you money. Unfortunately, it’s not going to make you much money in a standard low-yielding savings account. But it can make you a good deal of consistent money if you invest wisely in higher-yielding Dividend King stocks. Not only are you investing in reliable growth, but you’re also investing in a company with reliable dividends. Look at Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), for example. The company just approved its 63rd consecutive annual dividend increase, raising its quarterly dividend to 51 cents per share. It’s considered a Dividend King because it’s been paying out a dividend for more than 50 years. In KO’s case, it’s been distributing yield since 1971. Today, if you bought $25,000 worth of the KO stock, you would take ownership of 349 shares. With a $2.04 annual payout, you can sit back and collect about $712 in yearly income. And all you had to do was buy and hold a popular stock. As for other Dividend Kings to consider, here are three you may want to buy today. Pepsico With a yield of 4.3%, Pepsico (NASDAQ: PEP) is a familiar name with a strong, dependable yield. PEP has now raised its dividend for the 53rd time since 1965. Most recently, PEP paid out a quarterly dividend of $1.4225 per share – a 5% increase year over year – on June 30. Annualized, that’s $5.69. So, if you invest $25,000 in PEP now, you can take ownership of about 188 shares. You’re buying a dependable company with years of success. And, using today’s PEP price of $132.60, you can collect $1,069.72 in yearly income just by holding the PEP stock. Helping, analysts at RBC just reiterated a sector perform rating on the stock with a target price of $163 per share. We also have to consider the company is investing in inorganic growth as it gets more involved with healthier food and beverages. For example, PEP just acquired Poppi – a healthy soda brand – for $1.95 billion. American States Water With a yield of 2.41%, Dividend King, American States Water (NYSE: AWR) provides water and electric services with a strong history of consistent dividend increases. It’s paid out a dividend every year since 1931. While it may sound boring, it’s a moneymaker with a tight dividend. Just last month, AWR approved a quarterly dividend of $0.4655 per share – its 356th consecutive dividend – which is payable on June 3 to shareholders of record as of May 19. Annualized, that’s $1.862. If you invested $25,000 in AWR, you’d take ownership of just over 322 shares. That would hand you about $599.56 per year in dividends. Helping, AWR just blew earnings out of the water. In its first quarter, EPS of 70 cents beat by three cents. Revenue of $148.01 million, up 9.4% year over year, beat by $2.16 million. Plus, analysts at Wells Fargo just upgraded AWR to an equal weight rating with a price target of $84. Target With a yield of 4.73%, Target (NYSE: TGT) is another interesting, yielding opportunity. The company just declared a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share. Annualized that’s $4.48 per share. If you were to buy $25,000 worth of the TGT stock, you’d take ownership of just under 264 shares. Not only can you profit from potential stock price appreciation, but you can also collect an annual dividend of $1,182.72. Granted, Target has come under pressure on earnings. However, it does look like most of the negativity has been priced into the retailer. Helping, TD Cowen analysts initiated coverage of the stock with a hold rating with a price target of $105. “The analysts highlighted Target’s attractive core business, which is supported by innovative and exclusive products, as well as profitable digital fulfillment strategies with potential for scale,” as noted by Investing.com. If you want to diversify even more, there are always dividend-paying ETFs. SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF With an expense ratio of 0.07% and a yield of just under 5%, the SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYD) tracks the total return performance of the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index, which is designed to measure the performance of the top 80 high dividend stocks on the S&amp;P 500. At the moment, it has 77 holdings. Some of its top holdings include CVS Health Group, Consolidated Edison, Philip Morris, AT&amp;T, Exelon Corp., Verizon, and Altria Group to name just a few. iShares Core High Dividend ETF There’s also the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSE: HDV). With an expense ratio of 0.08% and a yield of 3.36%, the HDV ETF tracks the investment results of an index composed of relatively high dividend-paying U.S. equities. Some of its 75 holdings include Exxon Mobil, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Progressive Corp., Chevron, AbbVie, Philip Morris, AT&amp;T, and Coca-Cola.

TGT,2025-06-04 16:10:02,3 Small-Cap Dividend Stocks Under $50 With Big Potential,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/3-smallcap-dividend-stocks-under-50-with-big-potential-20250604.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the current market climate, investors are increasingly shifting to defensive strategies. As investors navigate the turbulent waters of tariff-driven volatility in 2025, dividend stocks have emerged as a safe harbor, delivering superior returns compared to the broader market. While the default strategy might be to anchor portfolios with blue-chip payers like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), smart money might also look to small-cap stocks. These smaller companies, typically with market caps under $2 billion, often possess untapped potential and the capacity for substantial upside due to their lower starting valuations. Our research has uncovered three intriguing small-cap dividend stocks, all trading below $50 per share, that appear poised for potential future appreciation. It&#8217;s true that small-cap investments come with elevated risk, but the potential rewards can be equally substantial. While we lack a crystal ball, these selected companies have demonstrated promising performance and attractive dividend yields. We acknowledge that some of these selections may have grown slightly beyond the conventional $2 billion small-cap threshold; however, their continued presence in prominent small-cap ETFs confirms their relevance to this segment. Key Points Kodiak Gas Services (KGS): High 5.1% yield, strong EBITDA growth, and analyst upgrades support potential return to 52-week highs. Buckle (BKE): Zero debt, rising same-store sales, and 16% margins make it a resilient small-cap retail dividend pick. Farmers National (FMNB): 5.1% yield, strong Q1 earnings growth, and expanding deposits highlight this undervalued small-cap bank’s upside. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Kodiak Gas Services (NYSE: KGS) There are a couple of reasons to like Kodiak Gas Services (NYSE: KGS) stock. At $36 per share, Kodiak offers a high dividend yield of 5.1%. Given its market capitalization of $3.1 billion, Kodiak is in the gray area for small-cap stocks but is included in Fidelity&#8217;s Small Cap Dividend Growth Fund. In Q2 2025, Kodiak announced an increase to its quarterly cash dividend to $0.45 per share, up 10% compared with Q4 2024 levels. If you were to purchase 100 shares of KGS stock at current levels and hold it for 10 years with DRIP, based on the latest performance, you could expect a total return of 57.3% as well as annual dividend income of $256.19. Over the past 12 months, Kodiak stock is up approximately 38.4%, though it continues to trade below its 52-week high of $50 per share. In its most recent quarterly results, Kodiak lifted the range of its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance in response to what management described as an &#8220;outstanding quarter.&#8221; With these positive catalysts, the stock could revisit recent highs sooner rather than later. Wall Street analysts are increasingly optimistic about Kodiak stock. Most recently, Stifel increased its price target on the stock by $1 to $46 per share with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating attached. The analyst firm said that despite an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, Kodiak is full speed ahead in the Permian basin, where it compresses natural gas for pipeline transportation. Buckle (NYSE: BKE) With a dividend yield of 3.2%, specialty retailer Buckle (NYSE: BKE) makes a quarterly distribution of $0.35 per share. The stock currently trades for approximately $42 per share, in the midpoint of its 52-week range. Wall Street analysts mostly advise holding the stock, with an average price target of $40 per share. The markets may be underappreciating BKE stock considering the company&#8217;s strong balance sheet. Buckle carries zero long-term debt. By purchasing 100 shares of BKE at current levels, and holding for 10 years with DRIP, you could expect annual dividend income of just over $191 and more than just a preservation of capital. Buckle recently reported a 6.1% jump in its same-store sales for the four-week period leading up to early May and has also been experiencing an increase in online sales. The company&#8217;s net sales in the same period increased 7% to $85.5 million. This performance is a shift from a tough 2024 in which revenues were on a downward trajectory. For example, in the first three quarters of 2024, Buckle suffered a 5% decline in revenues. But 2025 is off to a good start. In Q1, Buckle reported net income of $35.2 million, or $0.70 per share. Buckle competes with the likes of Target and Amazon but still manages an attractive profit margin of nearly 16%. If Buckle can keep up this performance, it might have further upside potential and could be worth a spot in a dividend investor&#8217;s portfolio. Farmers National (Nasdaq: FMNB) Canfield, Ohio-based Farmers National (Nasdaq: FMNB) stock trades for just over $13 per share. The company has a dividend yield of 5.1%. In May 2025, Farmers National recently declared its latest quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share. Wall Street has an average price target of $15 on Farmers National stock, reflecting upside potential of approximately 13%. FMNB stock is held by big institutions including BlackRock, Vanguard LSV Asset Management. With a purchase of 100 shares at current levels, and holding for 10 years with DRIP, you could expect annual dividend income of just over $111 and a total return of roughly 66% over that period. In Q1 2025, Farmers National reported net income of $13.6 million compared with $11.2 million year-over-year. Farmers National CEO Kevin Helmick described the bank&#8217;s &#8220;position of strength,&#8221; pointing to a &#8220;legacy of profitability, strong asset quality and robust liquidity levels&#8221; despite economic uncertainty. Farmers has growing customer deposits and has been expanding its footprint into new markets, the most recent of which was Columbus, Ohio. Investors who might want exposure to financial services might want to consider Farmers National for its steady dividend and potential for capital appreciation.

You likely have a pretty good idea of how much the family spends on food monthly. If you told your family members exactly what this number is, they&#8217;d likely be shocked. Key Points The cost of groceries is only going up, but it shouldn’t be a family’s biggest expense. In the case of this Redditor, the family is spending a good portion of their monthly income on food and dining out. There are several ways to reduce the cost of groceries, such as meal prepping each week. Are you spending too much money on groceries? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How much a family spends on groceries is exactly what one Redditor posting in r/MiddleClassFinance is worried about. In this family&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s far too easy to get carried away with overspending each month, especially when it comes to dining out. Large Grocery Bill What&#8217;s surprising is that this Redditor outright admits the family spends around $1,400 per month on groceries. For a family of three, including a two-year-old, this is entirely too much money. Having tracked their spending since June 2024, there is a real-world concern. When the Redditor breaks down this total number, we learn that the family’s average monthly grocery bill is $692. Additionally, they are spending $405 on fast food and takeout, as well as $289 on dining out. For a family earning around $9,000 per month, this number should be alarming. In fact, the grocery budget is likely their second biggest expense, after a mortgage, which is a reasonable concern. If the question is whether or not they are spending too much, the answer is a resounding yes. Average Monthly Spend According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly cost of groceries is $504 as of late 2024. The total annual cost for families should be approximately $6,043. Compared to other families, this family spends over $16,000 on food and groceries each month, far exceeding the average amount typically spent by families. Another consideration is that the US Department of Agriculture states that, for a family of four, the monthly budget in March 2025 should be $996. Even if you subtract a little for a family of three, their total expense is still well outpacing what the agreed-upon spending should be for a family. How to Spend Smarter First and foremost, this family and Redditor need to set up a detailed monthly budget to look at where they can cut back. Spending half of their grocery bill on food that is made at home is crazy. In other words, eating out and or bringing food in has to stop immediately. Setting a Budget There should be a budget set for how many times a month the family will order in or take out, and that’s all they can do for the whole month. Grocery spending is a necessity, but dining out or ordering fast food is a luxury. As a result, it shouldn’t be too challenging to make this change. Finding Coupons In addition, this family needs to become more savvy about coupons, discount grocery stores, and taking advantage of farmers’ markets, among other strategies. Using websites like iBotta or Coupons.com to save money can be a real advantage. Yes, it takes a little extra time to go through and save digital coupons, but the payoff is quickly evident in the savings. Meal Prepping Another potential option is meal prep for the family, which provides a set menu for the week. Let’s assume the family goes to the grocery shops on the weekend. This allows them to meal prep for the week, including lunches and dinners, which is likely where most of the excess spending goes. House Brands Another consideration is to buy generic brands at the grocery store, such as those from Great Value at Walmart or Favorite Day at Target. The savings here can really add up, and the food rarely tastes any different, so there is plenty of money to be saved. As someone who regularly buys Target’s house brands, I can personally attest to there being very little difference in taste, except that everything costs less.

Jennifer Quan, 24, of the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles, pleaded guilty in March to three federal counts of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. Quan used a variety of schemes to scam a wide range of victims out of more than $1 million, according to prosecutors, including: Quan's schemes ""showed ingenuity, cunning, and creativity — but little remorse,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said. She went out of her way to hurt others, prosecutors said, more than once calling DoorDash to exact revenge on delivery drivers by demanding that the employee not get paid or be suspended from their job. ""Defendant's lies risked cheating these Dashers out of their livelihoods,"" prosecutors wrote, adding that Quan also lied to U.S. Pretrial and Probation Services and defied a judge's orders. The DoorDash scam involved her exploiting DoorDash's status as a third party between independent-contractor delivery drivers, called Dashers, and major retailers from whom DoorDash fulfills delivery orders. She called DoorDash's support line posing as the owner of stores from which she ordered delivery. She would tell the support agent that the order had not been picked up by a delivery driver and it should be canceled, when in reality she had already received the items herself, court documents show. Court documents detail how Quan's often chaotic phone calls, filled with unusual claims, were apparently successful. Prosecutors detailed this excerpt from a single phone call, which involved Quan posing as the ""owner"" of Sephora and Target: ""Hello, I work at the restaurant, I need you to reverse the status and unassigned the Dasher from a completed order because the item is still at my store ... Yeah, the customer's name is Maggie G. My store's name is Sephora; I'm the owner. My name is Laura ... Now please, please cancel it 'cause, um, we aren't able to fulfill it no more ... ""Now I — yeah I need you to reverse another order and cancel it. So my other order is for the same customer but at my other store called Target. Same issue ... The store Target, I own that as well, and it has the same issue, so I'm going to need you to reverse the status and cancel ... ""Now for one more order, I need you to reverse the status and cancel it ... the order is called Target, as well ... can you refund the customer to her card? ... So did this get refunded to her credit card, sweetheart? ... Thank you, sweetie."" Immediately upon being released on bond, Quan began transferring over $150,000 from undisclosed accounts in structured amounts of $9,999, contravening the magistrate judge's orders, prosecutors said. ""And despite the heightened scrutiny, she continued her DoorDash fraud scheme while on bond,"" they wrote. Court papers show Quan defrauded fashion companies by impersonating influencers and their employees by creating email accounts displaying similar names. She then sent emails and texts to famous fashion brands, including Authentic Brand Group, House of CB, Pretty Little Thing, and Fashion Nova, impersonating the influencers or posing as their assistants, according to court documents obtained by Patch. The influencers were identified in court only by the initials B.M., K.J., J.S. and L.R. Prosecutors say Quan created email addresses that referenced the influencers' names and reached out to companies in order to enter into ""influencer agreements,"" claiming that she would use the celebrities' social media platforms to advertise and promote the companies' products. In one instance, she wrote from an email purported to be associated with B.M. to Fashion Nova, where she stated “I typically charge $6k a month but that depends. I also receive clothing or materials to create content as well. The rate is negotiable,"" documents show. In another instance, she wrote to Authentic Brand Group, stating “My name is [V.V.] and I am one of the assistants to [K.J.]” and “We are currently working on a secret project and wanted to feature some of your styles,"" according to documents. In total, Quan fraudulently caused the fashion companies to send her nearly $121,000 in cash, jewelry and merchandise, court papers show.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values. He said at an event in New York, “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think” they can&#8230;“My own view is people feel pretty good because you haven’t [yet] seen effective tariffs&#8230;The market came down 10%, [it’s] back up 10%; that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.&#8221; Ray Dalio Comments on US Debt 11:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, reportedly raised a flag that Moody&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating misses a crucial point regarding the vulnerability of U.S. Treasuries. According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18. Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a significant gainer, soaring 25.9% following regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares are lower by 4.4% on the back of an analyst downgrade. Take-Two Interactive Software (Nasdaq: TTWO) is bucking the trend, climbing 3.7% after a price target increase from Wedbush Securities.

TGT,2025-04-16 12:30:14,Why Do Chase Shopping Offers Feel Blah Compared to Capital One’s 100+ Deals?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/why-do-chase-shopping-offers-feel-blah-compared-to-20250416.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the world of cash-back credit cards, Chase and Capital One are undoubtedly two of the best places to start. With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it’s concerning that this isn’t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it’s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy’s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I’m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You’ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster’s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One’s layout is far easier to navigate, but it’s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn’t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache.

Economists predict that these tariffs will affect everything from groceries to car prices. With Americans already reeling from high prices at the grocery store, finding lower grocery prices may have a significant impact on your wallet. Economists predict the groceries that are likely to be the most impacted include fruits and vegetables imported from other countries, maple syrup, avocados, and imported alcohol such as beer, whiskey, and tequila. Walmart may be known for discount prices, but it&#8217;s not the only store that offers consumers great value. At 24/7 Wall St., we took a deep dive to find eight discount grocers across the country that can compete, or even go lower than Walmart&#8217;s prices. Read on for where you can find the best deals in your area. (This article was updated on April 2, 2025, to reflect recent economic news regarding the rising cost of products after President Trump&#8217;s newly imposed tariffs.) Why We&#8217;re Covering This Now Economists warn that already high grocery prices will continue to rise under President Trump&#8217;s new tariff plans. No one wants to break the bank when it comes to shopping for groceries and other everyday items. This is especially true today, as inflation is on the rise and prices are higher than ever (especially groceries!) But even though Walmart offers competitive low prices, you might not always be getting the best deals. 8. Market Basket Market Basket offers a lot of value for its customer base. Location: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island Number of Locations: 95 Known for: Being one of the least expensive groceries in the New England area, with a “more for your dollar” slogan Best things to buy: New England fish items like clams, fresh seafood, maple syrup, pears, apples More in Your Basket There is something special about Market Basket pricing. According to a recent study, Market Basket&#8217;s pricing was 18% lower than that of other Boston-area groceries. This study found that a family spending $250 per week on groceries could save as much as $2,300 annually by shopping at Market Basket. The privately owned business heavily focuses on keeping prices down, which has helped Market Basket earn a reputation as one of the cheapest grocery stores in the U.S. 7. Food 4 Less Food 4 Less is more than living up to its name. Location: California, Illinois, Indiana Number of locations: 101 Known for: A no-frills grocery store where customers bag their groceries Best things to buy: Organic orange juice, cage-free brown eggs, vegetable chips, and organic creamy peanut butter A Kroger Brand Food 4 Less is backed by its parent company, Kroger. Located in just four states, the Kroger-owned Food 4 Less brand is quickly becoming a go-to choice for customers looking for inexpensive groceries. These locations sell dry goods, canned goods, baking supplies, and organic and non-organic produce for less. The same can be said for health and beauty items, though Walmart has a larger selection overall. 6. H-E-B H-E-B is a bona fide Texas staple. Location: Texas and Mexico Number of locations: 400 Known for: Being region-specific to just Texas, with 380 stores in Texas and a few dozen in Mexico Best things to buy: Whataburger sauces, Texas-branded products, Taste of San Antonio, fajitas, tortillas, and more Better in Texas H-E-B offers food items you can&#8217;t find at your local Walmart. As Texans believe everything is better in Texas, this might be true if you shop at a H-E-B grocery store. Considered one of the best privately owned groceries in the country, H-E-B pricing compares very well to Walmart while offering things you can’t get at any Walmart location. However, where H-E-B truly wins is its low-priced yet outstanding quality meats and produce, which Walmart cannot match. 5. Lidl Lidl is attempting to enter the US market. Location: Eastern U.S. Number of locations: 185 Known for: Fantastic selection of low-price items, including store-brand items, which account for 80% of the store’s inventory Best things to buy: Seafood and dairy, organic meats, organic fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and fair-trade chocolates Store-Branded Everything With its competitive pricing, Lidl will grow quickly in the US. Another international brand trying to carve out a niche in the United States, Lidl is already well on its way to success. With 185 stores and growing, Lidl beats out Walmart in the idea that over 80% of the items in Lidl stores are store-branded. This means they are cheaper than brand-name items and even cheaper than Walmart’s private-label brands. Ultimately, Lidl is cheaper and healthier with grass-fed meats, organic fruits and vegetables, and organic dairy products. 4. WinCo Foods WinCo Foods is a surprisingly delightful place to shop due to its pricing. Location: Western U.S. Number of locations: 141 Known for: Midwest-based employee-owned grocery store with more than 20,000 employees Best things to buy: Boxed foods, dairy products, and bulk cheeses are said to save customers a lot of money The Midwest Surprise You won&#8217;t be disappointed with the price when you enter WinCo Foods. With only 141 employee-owned locations in the Midwest, many Americans can’t walk into a WinCo Foods store. However, for those who can, the bulk purchase area in its stores can be vastly cheaper than Walmart. Everything from Arizona Iced Tea, soft drinks, eggs, spices, smoked and grilled items, and barbecue charcoal is cheaper than at Walmart. This is a testament to the employee-owned nature of WinCo Foods, as they are focused on inexpensive pricing and not driving big profits. 3. Costco Shopping at Costco offers a unique experience compared to Walmart. Location: Throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 627 Known for: Bulk purchases, exclusive items under the Kirkland brand, regional inventory Best things to buy: Frozen foods, lunch items, fresh food, baking, and cooking essentials Buying In Bulk Buying in bulk at Costco can be much less expensive than at Walmart. Costco’s pricing can be better than Walmart&#8217;s in multiple categories if you like to stock up on items simultaneously. It’s widely considered cheaper to purchase fresh food and frozen foods, and even some staples like milk and eggs can be less expensive at Costco. However, when you buy in bulk, Costco shines. Even though you will pay more upfront, you’ll restock less, which makes things like paper towels and toilet paper less expensive than Walmart. 2. Aldi Aldi beats Walmart in price in multiple categories, such as daily food staples. Location: 40 states throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 2,489 Known for: No-frills shopping experience with numerous private-label products Best things to buy: German foods, baking ingredients, basic food staples, pre-cooked frozen foods The German Giant Aldi offers a no-frills grocery shopping experience. Aldi is expected to have close to 3,200 locations by 2028, making it a formidable competitor to Walmart’s grocery business. Compared to Walmart, there is an expectation that you should be able to walk out of Aldi for at least a few dollars less than you would spend at Walmart if you took a list of the same items. Fans of the brand love it for basic food staples like milk and eggs, as well as foreign food items you can’t get at Walmart. 1. Target Target&#8217;s house brands are competitively priced compared to Walmart&#8217;s. Location: Throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 1,978 Known for: High-quality, low-priced items across food, clothing, beauty, and more Best things to buy: Up &amp; Up cleaning products, deal-worthy essentials Walmart’s Biggest Competitor Target is consistently looking to beat Walmart&#8217;s pricing. When you think of Walmart and competition, it goes without saying that Target is at the very top of the list. While Walmart is generally considered the less expensive of the two, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of items where Target beats Walmart, including bottled water and house-branded cleaning supplies. In many cases, Target’s Cat &amp; Jack brand also offers better pricing for kids’ clothing.

The current market uncertainty has sparked investor interest in exchange-traded funds and there are plenty to choose from. Since no two funds are equal, you need to choose one based on your goals, risk, and investment horizon. Schwab has several funds that attract investor interest but one fund stands apart for dividend income investors. If you do not want to risk investing in individual stocks but want to enjoy steady passive income, consider Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). Key points in this article: The ongoing market uncertainty has drawn investors towards low-risk ETFs. The Schwab U.S. Dividend equity ETF has shown steady dividend growth for 12 years. If you think you aren&#8217;t anywhere close to your retirement goals, check out the SmartAsset’s free tool that can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer your questions. They have carefully vetted advisors that act in your best interests. You can get started by clicking here. (Sponsor) How does SCHD work? The Schwab U.S. Dividend ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and invests in a bucket of stocks that have record annual dividend increases. The Net Asset Value of the ETF is $27.58 and enjoys a dividend yield of 3.49%. It is up 3.26% in the year and over 80% in the past five years. The fund has shown a consistent dividend growth of 12 years and has a record of double-digit annualized returns. While past performance is no guarantee for future returns, this fund has managed to prove its strength time and again. The fund has a low expense ratio of 0.060%. By choosing to invest in only those companies that have a record of 10 or more annual dividend increases, the fund sets the bar very high. It does not include Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in its holdings. The fund holding is updated annually, thus, making it easier to remove companies that do not make it to the elite list. This ensures that the fund is always doing well. In a rare move, the EFT went for a three-for-one stock split last year. Low-risk, low-cost and steady returns SCHD (1.17%) has done better than the Nasdaq 100 (-10.15%) and S&amp;P 500 (-4.90%) this year due to its limited exposure to the technology sector. There is a general fear that the AI bubble has burst and this caused tech stocks to drop. SCHD wasn’t much affected by the dip because it invests a small percentage in the tech sector. The fund was recently rebalanced and it removed some of the elite companies like BlackRock and Pfizer. It has also shifted the sectors focusing more on the energy sector this year. Its portfolio reflects: Energy: 21% Consumer staples: 18.7% Healthcare: 16.1% Industrials: 12.5% Technology: 7.9% The ETF holds 97 stocks and has some of the biggest companies that have survived several market ups and downs. Its largest investment lies in ConocoPhillips, Merck &amp; Co., Schlumberger NV, Target Corporation, and General Mills Inc. These are dividend aristocrats who believe in rewarding shareholders. SCHD is very affordable in terms of the expense ratio and has rewarded investors steadily over the years. The fund offers diversification which is a major consideration in current times. With limited allocation to technology stocks, SCHD remains shielded from the market ups and downs to a certain extent. About half of the fund’s portfolio lies in consumer staples and healthcare which are two indomitable industries in the economy. Its top holdings of dividend paying companies ensure a diversified mix and reliable dividends for the years to come. SCHD offers elite stocks for your portfolio The reason why you should own SCHD ETF is to achieve ultimate portfolio diversification. The ETF is attractive because it invests in financially strong businesses with historically high yields. It picks the companies that not only have a high yield but also dividend growth. With a yield of 3.5%, higher than the 1.2% offered by the S&amp;P 500 index, SCHD ETF can help build a financially strong portfolio. Buying each of these stocks could cost you more but investing in a low-cost ETF can help build a portfolio that pays regularly. With a single investment, you get to own the biggest companies and enjoy passive income which is why it should be a core holding. In the long term, SCHD’s performance will continue as it has done in the past.

The impact of these levies—targeting everyday items like clothing, electronics, and groceries—will ripple through consumer spending habits and drive up costs in sectors where affordability is already a concern.Economists from Bank of America and BNP Paribas expect the February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report to provide the first clear indications of these tariffs&#8217; effect, with further increases anticipated in the coming months. As US retailers, including Target and Best Buy, brace for higher costs, long-term inflation expectations have climbed to near 30-year highs. The burden will fall hardest on those already struggling with rising living expenses, as businesses pass higher import costs onto consumers.Low-income consumers hit hardest by rising costsFamilies with tighter budgets, who typically allocate a larger share of their income to necessities, are particularly vulnerable to these price hikes. Goods sourced from China, Mexico, and Canada—such as furniture, fresh produce, and energy supplies—are becoming more expensive, compounding financial pressures on low-income consumers who have been dealing with high inflation and borrowing costs.Retail giants have already signaled that price increases are inevitable. Target CEO Brian Cornell has warned that tariffs on key imports, such as Mexican fruits and vegetables, will make it challenging to maintain stable pricing.Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, has also noted growing &#8220;stress behaviors&#8221; among budget-conscious shoppers, with some switching to smaller pack sizes or opting for less expensive alternatives. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Walmart has begun negotiating with Chinese suppliers, requesting price cuts of up to 10% to mitigate the effects of tariffs. However, such efforts may not be enough to shield customers from rising costs.Inflation concerns escalate as consumer spending slowsHigher import duties are expected to act as a hidden tax on consumers, further slowing already tepid spending growth. The Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book report has highlighted increased price sensitivity among shoppers, particularly for non-essential items.This shift in consumer behavior suggests that inflationary pressures are reshaping purchasing decisions, leading to a decline in demand for discretionary goods.David French, executive vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, has pointed out that these tariffs function as a &#8220;consumption tax,&#8221; disproportionately affecting lower-income families. Unlike traditional tax policies, these trade levies increase the cost of essential goods, making it harder for vulnerable households to maintain their standard of living.The economic consequences of these tariffs are particularly stark for households at the lower end of the income spectrum. Between February 2020 and June 2024, the poorest 20% of US households experienced an 8.3% faster rise in consumer prices compared to the wealthiest segment, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.This divergence in inflation rates has contributed to broader economic discontent, influencing voter sentiment in the 2024 election cycle.Trump’s tariff strategyDonald Trump’s current trade policies mark a significant shift from his first-term tariff approach, which initially focused on industrial materials like steel and aluminum. This time, the measures are far more aggressive, pushing average US tariff rates to their highest levels since World War II.The latest round of levies includes a broad array of consumer goods, raising concerns about prolonged inflationary effects.Despite the financial strain on households, the White House has defended the policy, arguing that tariffs will ultimately benefit American workers and businesses. A White House spokesperson stated that the administration’s strategy aims to &#8220;raise wages, create jobs, and expand investment,&#8221; dismissing concerns about short-term price increases as a &#8220;little disturbance&#8221; that the economy can absorb.However, for many American families already facing financial hardship, the reality is far more immediate. The combination of tariffs, stagnant wages, and existing economic pressures is making it increasingly difficult for some households to afford basic necessities.As the effects of these tariffs take hold, the question remains: how will struggling consumers navigate an economy where the cost of living continues to climb?The post US tariffs fuel inflation, putting pressure on low-income households appeared first on Invezz",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/11/us-tariffs-fuel-inflation-putting-pressure-on-low-income-households/

TGT,2025-02-25 11:32:12,"Seriously, get and use a credit card. There are 5 big reasons they’re better",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/seriously-get-and-use-a-credit-card-there-are-20250225.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"With the widespread release of credit cards in the 1950s and 1960s, they have since become ubiquitous in everyday life. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 82% of American adults have a credit card, and nearly 1.3 billion Visa credit cards exist, followed by another 1.1 billion Mastercard credit cards. Key Points Credit cards can be one of the smartest financial moves someone makes. The biggest thing to be aware of with a credit card is that you must pay off your balance as quickly as possible. Credit cards are far more secure than debit cards regarding fraudulent purchases. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) It’s important to understand just how many credit cards exist because they have become essential. As most Americans don’t have significant disposable income or savings, credit cards have become a staple way to make large purchases that can be paid off in installments, undoubtedly enabling the economy to grow over the last seven decades. Of course, credit cards are still seen as a way to get into debt if not used responsibly, something this Redditor posting in r/personalfinance explains perfectly. Credit Cards Are Safe One thing that should immediately be screamed from the rooftops is that credit cards are one of the safest payment options. When you consider that 90% of Americans have a debit card, they may be more likely to use this as a payment option. The problem is that debit cards are not any safer than credit cards and offer far less protection. A debit card will immediately remove funds from your bank account, so you are making an “immediate” payment. However, the cash is gone instantly if someone hits the wrong number while ringing up a transaction. It’ll take a big lift for you to call the bank to get the situation cleared up, and in the meantime, you may not be able to pay your bills. Now, consider the credit card option because you have a window of opportunity to handle any fraudulent or errant transactions. A credit card doesn’t require payment immediately, so you have some time to mount a case of why a credit card should reverse a transaction in the case of fraud. The bottom line is that credit cards are much safer no matter what type of purchase you want to make. Establish Credit For Yourself One of the biggest benefits of a credit card, if used responsibly, which is the big caveat here, is that it’s one of the best ways to build up your credit. Your credit history will be essential whenever you want to buy a car, rent an apartment, or get a mortgage for a home, and a credit card can help. As long as you make on-time credit card payments, it shows you are reliable and can pay off your purchases regularly. Even if you don’t pay off your entire balance every month, this is okay, as making regular payments is more important than the payment amount itself. The biggest consideration here is that you don’t miss a payment, ever, which is where the responsibility argument comes into play. The Redditor points out that the ideal way to manage your credit cards is never to charge more than you can pay off in one month, which is a good rule of thumb. Protect Your Purchases One of my absolute favorite reasons for having multiple credit cards in my wallet is the idea of purchase protection. This could materialize in several ways, but they all go above and beyond what you would receive when you pay with cash or a debit card. For example, many credit cards will provide an additional year of warranty to a purchase, which is 100% more time than you receive from the manufacturer. In other words, if Apple gives you a one-year warranty on your next iPhone, your Visa card will provide you with a second year. Many credit cards also offer accidental damage coverage, which provides excellent peace of mind for anyone who accidentally damages a new computer or television within the first few months of ownership. Last but not least is price protection. Most retail stores have a limited price guarantee period, which a credit card will extend. Take Target, for example, as their price guarantee is only 14 days, but the Capital One Quicksilver card will give you 120 days up to $250 per item. Credit Card Rewards One of the biggest reasons for having a credit card is that you can earn cash back on every purchase. For example, my Capital One Quicksilver card gives me 1.5% cash back on every purchase I make. As of mid-February 2025, I’ve already earned over $68 in rewards from my purchases, and there are still 10.5 months left in the year. It’s difficult to argue against the idea that you can make “free” money responsibly using a cash-back credit card. Of course, different cards have different rewards, so some research is required to determine which card is best for you. Still, if you spend big at the grocery store every month, an American Express card offering 6% cash back on all grocery purchases will have you see dollar signs as far as the rewards you can earn during a 12-month period. Cardholder Perks Building on the idea of credit card rewards being a significant perk of using a credit card, the perks go beyond just receiving cash back in many cases. When you look at a card like the American Express Blue Cash Preferred, these perks come to life. This is the very same credit card that will offer you 6% cash back on every grocery purchase. However, the perks with this card go well beyond grocery shopping. One of the most significant benefits of this card is that it offers you a $84 Disney Bundle Credit every year. If you spend $9.99 monthly on a Disney Bundle subscription, American Express will give you $7 cashback if this card remains on your Disney account. If you are a frequent traveler, using a credit card like the Capital One Venture Rewards credit card will get you a $120 credit you can use to purchase Global Entry or TSA PreCheck. Better yet, many travel cards will give you access to travel lounges around the country to relax before you board your flight. Go Ahead, Use A Credit Credit Ultimately, the benefits this Redditor points out make a compelling argument for why people should use credit cards. Of course, there is the consistent caveat that to truly enjoy all of the benefits of a credit card, you must make responsible purchases and pay off your balance as fast as possible. The last thing you want is to get overzealous and rack up a giant credit card bill earning 29% interest you can’t quickly pay off. However, as long as you are responsible, want to build up your credit, earn some cash back, and use a card that offers some valuable perks, grabbing a credit card can be your best financial move.

The Dow is spiraling by 500 points and is being pressured by retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT), whose earnings results confirmed tariff-related fears. Among the few technology gainers are Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) as of early trading. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is among the rare gainers in the Dow today. Walmart warned that its profit growth is expected to slow down amid the company’s vulnerability to the likely Mexico and Canada tariffs. Walmart’s stock is down over 6% despite beating consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q4 as Wall Street focuses on an uncertain future. Nevertheless, TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance that Walmart is “hitting on all cylinders” for now, pointing to a resilient consumer that continues to drive revenue. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 502.74 (-1.13) Nasdaq Composite: -165.58 (-0.80%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.26 (-0.72%) Key Points The Dow Jones Industrial Average is spiraling by 500 points. Alibaba shares are soaring after a blowout quarterly earnings report. Big Tech stocks are mixed. Palantir is sinking on fears of U.S. defense budget cuts. Market Movers Alibaba is boosting tech sentiment today, rising 11.7% on the heels of its fiscal Q3 earnings report, which executives attributed “robust” AI momentum . The company’s results were driven by cloud technology as well as AI-product revenue, both of which have been soaring. Alibaba is also receiving tailwind’s from China’s competitive AI investments, including DeepSeek, as a result of which BABA stock has skyrocketed 50% so far in 2025. Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is giving up some of its recent gains, falling below the psychologically sensitive $100 level today amid a 13% drop in the stock. The Trump Administration is defense budget cuts, the industry for which Palantir creates AI-powered software solutions. Toy company Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) is among the winners in today’s session, gaining 11% on the heels of a quarterly earnings and revenue beat. Hasbro has also launched a new line of PLAY-DOH Barbie dolls in a licensing partnership with Mattel that is set to hit the store shelves at Target (NYSE: TGT). Apple shares are posting fractional gains a day after introducing the lower-priced iPhone 16. Citi analysts expect this model will represent 10% of the company’s units sold in 2025.

Rest assured that Costco’s competitors are everywhere, and many specifically target its pricing and selection to win new customers over. Key Points While Costco might be the most popular bulk shopping location, it’s not the only one. Sam’s Club and BJ’s are both looking to steal Costco’s market share. Walmart and Target also have great deals on bulk items, especially online. Also: Discover “The Next NVIDIA” When you think about Costco, you think about electronics, televisions, samples, bulk toilet paper, bulk vitamins, and more. For most people, buying in bulk is all about saving, but the reality is that this feeling isn’t something you can only find at Costco but at numerous other retailers as well. 10. Albertsons Locations: 2,271 Known for: Locally grown produce, specialty meats, fresh fish, lots of cheese Best things to buy: The Albertson’s selection of cheese is second to none The Cheese Superstore Known for its large assortment of cheeses, Albertsons offers any number of bulk shopping items. Its selection doesn’t quite match Costco’s, but its prices sure do, and with a higher quality standard as well. Among its bulk specialties, Albertson’s excels with a meat and seafood selection, frozen foods, baby care, personal care, and cleaning and home products. Of course, don’t forget all the bulk cookies and snacks you hope to buy in one purchase. 9. Staples Locations: 994 Known for: Being a one-stop shop for office products Best things to buy: Office products, printers, chairs, computers The Office Superstore If you’re looking for an office superstore where you can bulk buy everything from staplers to printer paper, you can find it all at Staples. While Costco isn’t an office supply store, it does have the most common items you would find that Staples carries for far less. Staples is the best place for writing supplies, office basics, folders &amp; filing, desk organizers, and many storage and organization items. 8. AllBulkFoods Locations: 0 Known for: Buying everything in bulk, being online only Best things to buy: Baking, cooking products, candy, chocolate, nuts, organic snacks Dedicated Bulk Seller Relatively unknown to other names, AllBulkFoods is one of the best destinations for bulk everything. The company is proud to sell products by the “inner-pack, case, pallet, and a truckload” if that’s what everyone would like. The company makes a big sticking point that it’s an ideal shopping solution for weddings, family gatherings, holiday get-togethers, or just having friends who love to shop and enjoy a ton of bulk candy. 7. Amazon Locations: 0 Known for: A one-stop shop for everything in your life across any variety of products Best things to buy: Bulk everything like toilet paper, plasticware, food The Online Giant While it doesn’t have a physical presence with its bulk items, it’s hard to ignore just how many items you can buy in bulk on Amazon. When it comes to something like toilet paper, the sheer selection of bulk options you have is incredible. Do you need 90 or 108 toilet paper rolls in a single order? How about 360 plastic spoons? You can grab those on Amazon, too, with two-day delivery at a price that’s less than Costco. 6. Dollar Tree Locations: 15,288 Known for: Being an inexpensive variety discount store that operates in 48 states and Canada Best things to buy: Frozen foods, milk, eggs, pizza, ice cream One Dollar Goodness Dollar Tree is one of the best-known dollar stores in the country, famous for its variety of products. You can find almost anything at Dollar Tree, from private-label brands to food, dinnerware, glassware, snacks, party decorations, and more. This store is unique because you aren’t necessarily buying bulk items, but you can buy in bulk and spend less than you would at a store like Costco. 5. Winco Locations: 138 Known for: Being privately owned by employees as a no-frills warehouse-style Best things to buy: Groceries, bulk food Bulk Food Grocery The least-known name on this list, Winco Foods, is famous for being a bulk food destination. The family-style employee-owned grocery store offers a giant selection of bulk food items that would impress even the most die-hard Costco customer. Best of all, Winco has some of the best prices on dry and canned goods you can’t find anywhere else. Winco hopes to continue expanding into other markets so it can bring its bulk shopping selection to other states. 4. Target Locations: 1,956 Known for: Quality clothing, big electronics section, household goods, bedding, kitchen Best things to buy: Groceries, kids clothing, bulk items like toilet paper Bulky Bullseye Like Walmart, you might not think of Target in the same light as Costco for bulk purchases, but Target wants you to believe otherwise. This is especially true for bulk items in the household essentials category. Target is full of bulk laundry care products, Clorox wipes, trash bags, and more rolls of bulk toilet paper than you ever truly need to purchase at once. You can save 5% on every Target RedCard purchase, and no membership fee is required. 3. Walmart Locations: 10,586 Known for: Low-priced shopping, being a one-stop shop for everything in your life Best things to buy: Groceries, clothes, electronics, healthcare, medicine Big Bulk Section It’s okay if you don’t think of Walmart as a big bulk store similar to Costco, but Walmart is here to prove you wrong. Walmart’s website has an entire section dedicated to its bulk items, including hundreds of food items with significantly larger packaging that you would otherwise normally buy at Walmart. This includes bulk granola bars, pasta, rice, snacks, candy, chicken, chocolate, and more. 2. BJ’s Locations: 266 Known for: Saving up to 25% on groceries compared to traditional supermarket Best things to buy: Home decor, toys, electronics, groceries The Wholesale Club Touting the idea that you can save up to 25% on groceries compared to a traditional grocer, BJ’s makes a compelling argument over Costco. Better yet, you have the Wellsley Farms and Berkely Jensen brands, which not only rival Costco’s beloved Kirkland brand but, in many ways, beat it on price. Fill your cart with bulk deals at BJ’s and then use ExpressPay to scan products through a mobile pay and skip the checkout line. 1. Sam’s Club Locations: 599 Known for: Bulk items, low prices, no-frills shopping Best things to buy: Groceries, electronics, toilet paper, paper towels, medicine The “Other” Costco Walmart’s “Other” Location Widely considered Costco’s biggest competitor, Sam’s Club is widely known for its outstanding prices and benefits. Not only does Sam’s Club generally have a less expensive membership cost, but members of both clubs often rave about Sam’s Club discounts on beef, chicken, and alcohol, as well as having some name brands that Costco doesn’t offer in favor of its Kirkland branding.

TGT,2024-11-28 03:37:38,"Skip the Trip to Walmart, These 8 Stores Have Better Deals",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/skip-the-trip-to-walmart-these-8-stores-have-20241128.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"24/7 Insights Many believe that Walmart is the cheapest place to shop. Other retailers go out of their way to drop pricing below that of Walmart. Some of the best pricing can be found at regional grocers. Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold Forever When it comes to value pricing in the retail segment in the United States, there is a consistent belief that Walmart offers the best bang for your buck. While Amazon has certainly made a dent in Walmart with online sales, as far as physical stores go, the belief that Walmart is the least expensive isn’t always true. In many cases, other retail chains that compete with Walmart look at its pricing as the line in the sand. Said differently, plenty of competitors shop at Walmart and then determine in what categories they can beat Walmart’s pricing to attract customers to their stores. 8. Market Basket More In Your Basket Market Basket offers a lot of value for its customer base. Locations: 90 Known for: Being one of the least expensive groceries in the New England area with a “more for your dollar” slogan Best things to buy: New England fish items like clams, fresh seafood, maple syrup, pears, apples More In Your Basket There is something special about Market Basket pricing. According to a recent study, Market Basket’s pricing was 18% lower than other Boston-area groceries. This study found that a family spending $250 per week on groceries could save as much as $2,300 annually by shopping at Market Basket. The privately owned business heavily focuses on keeping prices down, which has helped Market Basket earn a reputation as one of the cheapest groceries in the US. 7. Food 4 Less Food 4 Less is more than living up to its name. Locations: 101 Known for: A no-frills grocery store where customers bag their groceries Best things to buy: Organic orange juice, cage-free brown eggs, vegetable chips, and organic creamy peanut butter A Kroger Brand Food 4 Less is backed by its parent company, Kroger. Located in just four states, the Kroger-owned Food 4 Less brand is quickly becoming a go-to choice for customers looking for inexpensive groceries. These locations sell dry goods, canned goods, baking supplies, and organic and non-organic produce for less. The same can be said for health and beauty items, though Walmart has a larger selection overall. 6. H-E-B H-E-B is a bonafide Texas staple. Locations: 420 Known for: Being region-specific to just Texas, with 380 stores in Texas and another few dozen in Mexico Best things to buy: Whataburger sauces, Texas-branded products, Taste of San Antonio, fajitas, tortillas, and more Better In Texas H-E-B offers food items you can’t find at your local Walmart. As Texans believe everything is better in Texas, this might be true if you shop at a H-E-B grocery store. Considered one of the best privately owned groceries in the country, H-E-B pricing compares very well to Walmart while offering things you can’t get at any Walmart location. However, where H-E-B truly wins is its low-priced yet outstanding quality meats and produce, which Walmart cannot match. 5. Lidl Lidl is attempting to enter the US market. Locations: 173 Known for: Fantastic selection of low-price items, including store-branded items, which account for 80% of the store’s inventory Best things to buy: Seafood and dairy, organic meats, organic fruits and vegetables, dairy products and fair-trade chocolates Store Branded Everything With its competitive pricing, Lidl will grow quickly in the US. Another international brand trying to carve out a niche in the United States, Lidl, is already well on its way to success. With 173 stores and growing, where Lidl beats out Walmart is the idea that over 80% of the items in Lidl stores are store-branded items. This means they are cheaper than brand-name items and even cheaper than Walmart’s private-label brands. Ultimately, Lidl is cheaper and healthier with grass-fed meats, organic fruits and vegetables, and organic dairy products. 4. WinCo Foods WinCo Foods is a surprisingly delightful place to shop due to its pricing. Locations: 141 Known for: Midwest-based employee-owned grocery store with more than 20,000 employees Best things to buy: Boxed foods, dairy products, and bulk chases are said to save customers a lot of money The Midwest Surprise You won’t be disappointed with the price when you enter WinCo Foods. With only 141 employee-owned locations in the Midwest, many Americans can’t walk into a WinCo Foods store. However, for those who can, the bulk purchase area in its stores can be vastly cheaper than Walmart. Everything from Arizona Iced Tea, soft drinks, eggs, spices, smoked and grilled items, and barbecue charcoal is cheaper than Walmart. This is a testament to the employee-owned nature of WinCo Foods, as they are focused on inexpensive pricing and not driving big profits. 3. Costco Shopping at Costco offers a unique experience compared to Walmart. Locations: 890 Known for: Bulk purchases, exclusive items under the Kirkland brand, regional inventory Best things to buy: Frozen foods, lunch items, fresh food, baking and cooking essentials Buying In Bulk Buying in bulk at Costco can be much less expensive than at Walmart. Costco’s pricing can be better than Walmart’s in multiple categories if you like to stock up on items simultaneously. It’s widely considered cheaper to purchase fresh food and frozen foods, and even some staples like milk and eggs can be less expensive at Costco. However, when you buy in bulk, Costco shines. Even though you will pay more upfront, you’ll restock less, which makes things like paper towels and toilet paper less expensive than Walmart. 2. Aldi Aldi beats Walmart in price in multiple categories, such as daily food staples. Locations: 2,443 Known for: No-frills shopping experience with numerous private-label products Best things to buy: German foods, baking ingredients, basic food staples, pre-cooked frozen foods The German Giant Aldi offers a no-frills grocery shopping experience. Aldi is expected to have close to 3,200 locations by 2028, making it a formidable competitor to Walmart’s grocery business. Compared to Walmart, there is an expectation you should be able to walk out of Aldi for at least a few dollars less than you would spend at Walmart if you took a list of the same items. Fans of the brand love it for basic food staples like milk and eggs, as well as foreign food items you can’t get at Walmart. 1. Target Target’s house brands are competitively priced compared to Walmart. Locations: 1,963 Known for: High-quality, low-priced items across food, clothing, beauty, and more Best things to buy: Up &amp; Up cleaning products, dealworthy essentials Walmart’s Biggest Competitor Target is consistently looking to beat Walmart’s pricing. When you think of Walmart and competition, it goes without saying that Target is at the very top of the competition. While Walmart is generally considered the less expensive of the two, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of items where Target beats Walmart, including bottled water and house-branded cleaning supplies. In many cases, Target’s Cat &amp; Jack brand also offers better pricing for kids’ clothing.
