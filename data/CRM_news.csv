CRM,2025-05-29 09:42:49,5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens on Thursday,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-on-20250529.jpg,https://www.investopedia.com,"Close U.S. stock futures are pointing sharply higher after a federal court struck down President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are jumping in premarket trading after the chipmaker posted record revenue that tops analysts' estimates; Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk says he has ended his government work; and Salesforce (CRM) reports better-than-expected results and lifts its full-year outlook. Here's what investors need to know today. 1. US Stock Futures Rise Following Court Ruling on Tariffs U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after a U.S. court ruling struck down President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs and Nvidia posted record revenue. Nasdaq futures are 1.4% higher after the tech-focused index slipped by 0.5% in the prior session as stocks fell ahead of Nvidia's earnings report. S&P 500 futures are up about 1% in early trading while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.4% higher. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade near $109,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is up at around 4.51%. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are little changed. 2. Federal Court Strikes Down Trump's 'Reciprocal' Tariffs A federal court late Wednesday struck down the ""reciprocal"" tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on the country's trading partners in early April, saying he had overstepped his authority. A three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Congress is typically responsible for imposing these levies and not the president alone. The ruling stopped Trump from enforcing the tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China that were aimed at combating fentanyl entering the U.S. The steel and aluminum tariffs Trump imposed in March weren't mentioned in the ruling. The White House immediately appealed the ruling, per reports. 3. Nvidia Stock Jumps on Soaring Revenue Despite Chip Restrictions Nvidia (NVDA) shares are jumping 6% in premarket trading after the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue rose to a record high, even as profit missed analysts' expectations because of export curbs. Nvidia reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share on revenue that jumped 69% year-over-year to $44.06 billion. While its quarterly sales exceeded analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, its profit did not, as Nvidia said it absorbed a $4.5 billion charge due to restrictions on the sale of its H20 chips to China. In the current quarter, Nvidia expects to take an $8 billion hit due to lost revenue from H20 sales. 4. Tesla CEO Musk Announces End to Government Role Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said in a post on his social media site X that his time at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ended. The announcement comes after he said earlier this week that he would return to ""spending 24/7 at work"" after investors had raised questions over whether the government position was distracting his focus from Tesla and his other companies. Musk announced in April that he would spend less time on work related to DOGE. Tesla shares are up more than 2% in premarket trading. 5. Salesforce Tops Q1 Expectations, Raises Full-Year Outlook Salesforce (CRM) on Wednesday reported first-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations and lifted its full-year outlook. The cloud software giant raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 revenue and adjusted EPS, citing demand for its AI products. Salesforce reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.58 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year rise to $9.83 billion, both above Visible Alpha consensus. Salesforce shares, which entered Thursday down 17% this year, are little changed in premarket trading. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

What’s Priced In, and What Could Change That 1:56 pm Investor sentiment toward Salesforce remains mixed. The stock is still down more than 16% year-to-date, even as margins have hit all-time highs and AI momentum is building. Analysts appear cautiously optimistic — 18 out of 23 rate the stock a Buy — but the average price target of $361 implies that a meaningful re-rating would require new growth drivers. Morningstar’s $315 fair value estimate adds further weight to the idea that CRM is fairly valued unless execution improves. Right now, the market seems to be pricing in steady but unspectacular top-line growth, mid-30% margins, and modest AI contribution. That means Salesforce could rally if it shows faster-than-expected ramp in Agentforce or Data Cloud ARR, or a material acceleration in current RPO, which would imply stronger near-term pipeline health. A beat-and-raise on EPS isn’t enough — what would truly shift sentiment is evidence that AI-led bundles are expanding deal size, not just being adopted. CRM Could Jump Higher If this Happens 12:48 pm Salesforce stock could surge if the company proves that its AI and Data Cloud ARR — which hit $900 million last quarter — is accelerating beyond early adoption into true enterprise-scale monetization. A sequential ARR jump or commentary linking AI usage directly to expanded deal value could re-ignite excitement around Salesforce&#8217;s GenAI strategy. Investors will also be looking for double-digit subscription revenue growth, particularly in core clouds like Sales and Data Cloud, to validate multicloud expansion across enterprise verticals. Another potential upside trigger: strong current RPO growth. If this short-term demand proxy rebounds from last quarter’s 9% pace, it will suggest improving sales velocity despite macro caution. And if Salesforce maintains or expands its 33%+ operating margin while continuing to deliver robust free cash flow, the narrative of a leaner, AI-leveraged Salesforce gets much stronger. A wave of large, multi-cloud deals with high attach rates — especially with industry bundles — would round out a bullish earnings release. Keys to watch 11:54 am 1. Subscription Revenue Durability Recurring revenue from Subscription and Support grew 10% in FY25 and will be a key signal of customer retention amid tightening IT budgets. 2. AI Monetization Through Agentforce &amp; Data Cloud Salesforce claims $900M in ARR tied to AI and Data Cloud — but investors need evidence of revenue uplift, not just platform usage. 3. Free Cash Flow Leverage With FY25 FCF up 31% YoY to $12.4B, the question is whether this margin expansion is sustainable as investment in AI accelerates. 4. RPO and Deal Composition Large multicloud deals are expanding, but slowing current RPO could signal macro softness or sales cycle elongation. 5. Platform Integration Payoff Investors want to see measurable returns from prior acquisitions (Slack, MuleSoft, Tableau) and cross-cloud bundling. Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) reports earnings after the close with shares up +3.7% over the past month, but still down –16.7% year-to-date and about 25% below their 52-week high of $369. Recent performance reflects investor uncertainty around AI monetization, macro software spending, and whether margin expansion has more room to run. Consensus estimates call for $9.15 billion in revenue (+10% YoY) and non-GAAP EPS of $2.38, in line with company guidance. The street is particularly focused on subscription revenue durability, AI platform monetization, and whether Agentforce and Data Cloud — which now account for $900 million in ARR — are translating into deal flow and pricing power. However, remaining performance obligation (RPO) growth and net new cRPO trends will be key tells on forward demand. While profitability has surged (non-GAAP op margin hit 31.4% in FY25), consensus is watching for sustained free cash flow conversion and whether Agentforce becomes more than an AI demo. Morningstar values the stock at $315 and assigns a “Wide Moat” rating — but Wall Street consensus price target is $362, leaving room for upside if Salesforce executes.

Stocks remain lower out of caution. Markets Hold Back 12:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s government officials have come out swinging against the White House, saying they strongly opposes what they described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also getting a pop from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a strong Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 114.55 (+0.26%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 102.00 (+0.57%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.36 (+0.41%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but that is what it takes to trade as one of the leading tech stocks. As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is taking a breather after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire options trading platform Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal, thrusting it into the crypto derivatives realm.

Earlier today, President Trump proved that he was willing to lower tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are expected to come to the negotiating table over the weekend. Stocks are under pressure on the trade deal uncertainty. Aimless Markets 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo Today&#8217;s gains have faded as traders hold out for closure on a trade agreement between the U.S. and China. The three major indices are now trading mixed, including a 0.06% gain in the S&amp;P 500, 0.13% gain in the Nasdaq Composite and 0.13% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Markets are likely to continue trading aimlessly until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. S&amp;P 500 This Week 10:15 am by Gerelyn Terzo Despite today&#8217;s gains, the S&amp;P 500 remains modestly lower for the week, with a 0.06% decline as of Friday morning. There&#8217;s still time for the index to push even higher, especially if the White House announces further tariff agreements with international trade partners. CNBC reported that the broader market index remains mired below a key resistance level, making it difficult for it to break out higher. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Tariffs are having a live by the sword, die by the sword effect, and today that is translating to gains. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from over 100% to 80%, saying that level seems reasonable as Washington, D.C. gears up for negotiations with Beijing. Stocks are rightfully cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning but keeping it modest. The SPX ETF is gaining 0.25% as of morning trading. China could be the first of many tariff deals in the works with U.S. trade partners, according to the White House, further lifting market sentiment. Most sectors of the economy are moving higher, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are participating in the gains, with Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) rising 1% while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is adding 6.8%. TSLA stock is on its way to reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being lifted in part by Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a desirable Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 82.49 (+0.20%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 114.14 (+0.63%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22.51 (+0.40%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but it&#8217;s also one of the leading tech stocks. As of Thursday, Palantir was added to the top-10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, with a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. Comparatively, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers below that level at $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is taking it on the chin today, down fractionally. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is skyrocketing by over 20% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue soared by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%.

The standardization of diverse datasets from sources such as clinical trials, electronic health records (EHRs), genomics, and real-world evidence is essential for the efficient exchange of information across various platforms and geographical regions. This standardization enhances multi-site clinical trials and cross-border research collaborations. Additionally, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cognitive computing play a vital role in transforming large volumes of raw data into actionable insights. These technologies help simplify reports and create interactive dashboards. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of analytics in pre-clinical trials, drug discovery, and clinical trials, particularly for applications such as patient recruitment and site identification, helps to reduce the workload for researchers and investigators. These factors contribute significantly to the growing adoption of analytics across the life sciences industry. Download PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=174990653 Browse in-depth TOC on ""Life Science Analytics Market"" 100 - Tables50 - Figures500 - Pages By Based on type, the life science analytics services market is categorized into two main types: managed services and professional services. In 2024, the managed services segment held the largest share of the life science analytics market. This significant share is largely due to the increasing demand for advanced insights, the need for cost-effective drug development, technological advancements in the industry, and the necessity for ongoing support in strategic decision-making. These factors make outsourcing analytics and consulting more attractive for life science companies. Leading companies in the field offer consulting services that leverage data and analytics to evaluate opportunities, design analytics strategies, and implement appropriate technology solutions. For instance, in May 2023, SAS Institute (US) partnered with HTEC (US) to deliver strategic analytics consulting services across various sectors, including life sciences and healthcare. By Based on applications, The life science analytics market is divided into several applications, including research & development, commercial analytics, regulatory compliance, manufacturing and supply chain optimization, and safety. In 2024, the research & development segment held the largest share of this market. This significant share is mainly due to its capacity to accelerate drug discovery, optimize clinical trials, and improve research accuracy through advanced data analysis and AI-driven insights. Additionally, factors such as increasing R&D expenditure in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors, a rise in patent expirations and declining drug pipelines, and a growing focus on personalized medicine and precision therapeutics are further driving growth in this segment. By geography, the life science analytics market is divided into five primary regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. The Asia Pacific region is expected to experience significant growth, with a noticeable annual growth rate during the forecast period. Key factors driving the expansion of life science analytics solutions in this region include a gradual shift towards adopting advanced technologies such as automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). Additionally, rising investments are attracting new market players, and the presence of leading educational institutions and research centers in Asia Pacific is fostering scientific innovation and technological advancement. Furthermore, increased direct investments from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in Europe and North America are anticipated to boost the adoption of life science analytics solutions in Asia.

Several analysts cited the early success of Agentforce, Salesforce’s platform that allows clients to build custom AI agents.Bank of America called the stock a top pick to deliver growth at a reasonable price. Salesforce (CRM) shares lost ground Thursday on the company's weaker-than-expected earnings and outlook, but Morgan Stanley analysts said they're still bullish on the stock, anticipating it has “significant room for upside” this year. Morgan Stanley pointed to the early growth of Agentforce, Salesforce’s new platform that allows clients to build custom AI agents. Since it was made generally available in October, Salesforce has closed more than 5,000 Agentforce deals, including 3,000 paid transactions. The analysts said shares could ""likely climb from here,"" reiterating an “overweight” rating and $405 price target, suggesting about 46% upside from Thursday's intraday price. “We would be strong buyers of Salesforce ahead of these potential improving numbers,” they said. Monetizing Agentforce is “still in the early stages,” analysts at Wedbush said, suggesting strong potential for growth. The cloud services company is “taking a prudent approach to scaling the Agentforce that will pay off over the long-term with the AI Revolution now entering the software phase,” they said, and maintained a price target of $425. Bank of America lowered its price target to $400 from $440, telling clients investors may have to wait until fiscal 2027 to see material revenue contributions from Agentforce. However, BofA said it still views the stock as a top pick and quality GARP (growth at a reasonable price) option. Shares of Salesforce were down about 3% at $298.55 in Wednesday afternoon trading, and have lost about 11% of their value since the start of the year.

(NASDAQ: META) is now a household name because of the foundational success it experienced in social media. But it has been over a decade since its IPO on May 18, 2012, As the only company in the ‘Magnificent Seven’ that has yet to undergo a stock split, an investor who purchased $1000.00 worth of META stock on the day it went public at $38.00 per share would now be sitting on an investment worth $16326.32, good for a gain of 1532.63%. But since its IPO date, a lot has changed. For starters, on Feb. 1, 2024, the company announced — alongside authorizing a $50 billion stock buyback — that shares of META would begin paying a dividend. And while its current yield of 0.32% may not seem like much, at its current price, that equates to $0.50 per share quarterly, or $2.00 per share annualized. META is the dominant player in the social media landscape but it is now branching out more broadly into tech, and specifically, the artificial intelligence (AI) space. It is the latter that the company is most heavily investing in now, and for that reason, it is also the primary driver of 24/7 Wall Street price predictions and forecasts for 2025-2030. Key Points in This Article: “Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 24/7 Wall Street projects a 60.38% upside potential for the stock through the end of the decade.

Recent Meta Stock Updates and News 12/11/2024 The Australian government has successfully compelled Meta to adhere to the News Media Bargaining Code, requiring the company to continue compensating Australian publishers for their journalism. 12/9/2024 Prosecutors in Italy have concluded an investigation into Meta for alleged tax evasion of €887.6 million, which was centered around two executives of Meta’s Irish unit. Next, the prosecutors will file a formal request for trial unless the accused can successfully prove their innocence. 12/6/2024 Meta reached a new all-time high today following a U.S. appeals court ruling. The court upheld a law mandating that ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese owner, divest the app by early 2024 or face a potential ban. This decision could potentially boost Meta due to a decline in TikTok’s user base and advertising revenue. 12/5/2024 Meta announced a new partnership with filmmaker James Cameron’s technology company, Lightstorm Vision. This collaboration aims to revolutionize the way 3D entertainment is experienced on Meta Quest VR headsets. 12/3/2024 Meta’s shares are surging today, hitting a new all-time high. The stock rose above its previous record of $601.20. 11/27/2024 Meta experienced a 1.5% decline today after COO Javier Olivan sold 413 shares at an average price of $562.77. 11/26/2024 Orange S.A. is partnering with OpenAI and Meta to bring AI-powered language models to African languages. The initiative will initially focus on West African languages and aims to launch in the first half of 2025. 11/25/2024 Meta Platforms is scheduled to face trial on April 14th in a long-standing antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to dismantle the company. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled today that the trial will proceed in Washington next year. 11/22/2024 The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected Meta’s appeal to dismiss a major class-action lawsuit brought by investors. The lawsuit, which seeks billions of dollars in damage, will be allowed to proceed. 11/21/2024 Meta has taken action against over 2 million accounts involved in “pig butchering” scams, which deceive users into investing in non-existent ventures. 11/20/2024 Meta has hired Salesforce’s former AI chief, Clara Shih, to lead its new Business AI group. Shih will focus on making cutting-edge Ai technology accessible to businesses of all sizes at Meta. Analysts at Jeffries are optimistic about this development, viewing it as a major step forward in Meta’s AI monetization strategy. Meta Platforms’ 10-Year Market Smashing Results Here’s a table summarizing the performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) of META stock from 2014 to 2024: Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $80.78 $12.466 $2.940 2015 $104.66 $17.928 $3.688 2016 $115.05 $27.638 $10.217 2017 $176.46 $40.653 $15.934 2018 $133.20 $55.838 $22.112 2019 $208.10 $70.697 $18.485 2020 $273.16 $85.965 $29.146 2021 $336.35 $117.929 $39.370 2022 $120.34 $116.609 $23.200 2023 $353.96 $134.902 $39.098 TTM $517.77 $161.579 $55.042 Revenue and net income in %billions Over the past decade, Meta Platforms’ revenue has grown 1,196.16% from $12.466 billion to over $161 billion over its trailing 12 months (TTM), while its net income went from $2.940 billion to over $55 billion TTM during the same period, good for an increase of 1,772.18%. The primary driver of that growth over the past 10 years has been ad space for the company’s social media platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Reel, and WhatsApp, among others. While Meta Platforms has branched out into augmented reality and virtual reality — a business segment it refers to as Reality Labs — 99% of its revenue generation comes from its Family of Apps business segment, as of year-end 2023. But as the company looks to the second half of the decade, Zuckerberg and the company will focus on a few key focus areas that will have a large impact on Meta Platforms’ stock performance. Key Drivers of Meta Platforms’ Stock Performance AI Investment: Founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta Platforms “released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we’re driving good growth across our apps.” While the market for Meta’s social media advertising remains healthy and continues to drive the majority of the company’s revenue, it is focusing heavily on AI investments to expand through the end of the decade. Price-per-ad revenue saw a 10% year-over-year gain, and that success will fund its AI spending aimed at future growth. The company said shareholders should expect between $37 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year that will fund a data center capable of powering its AI initiatives. That is likely to continue into next year, with CFO Susan Li stating that the META expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.” Continued Renewable Energy Development: According to the company’s net zero plan, which it is aiming to achieve by 2030, “Since 2020, Meta’s global operations have been supported by 100% renewable energy. As of 2023, we have 10,000MW of contracted renewable energy across 6 countries.” As part of its net zero plan, Meta Platforms’ reliance on renewable energy will ultimately decrease the cost of its utility expenses, and ultimately, its carbon footprint through contracted and self-employed green technologies. Renewables already cost less than fossil fuel energy sources, and according to Canary Media, “By 2030, technology improvements could slash today’s prices by a quarter for wind and by half for solar.” The company has announced that its goal for its forthcoming data center is that it is 100% sustainable and net zero. Focusing on Growing Free Cash Flow: Zuckerberg coined the 2023 Meta Platforms “year of efficiency,” and their results were staggering. By year-end, the company recorded a record free cash flow of $43 billion. That is up from $21 billion in 2019, marking a nearly 105% increase in its cash position in four years. Meta’s free cash flow TTM stands at $49.74, showing that its focus on its bottom line is driving decisions from the top down and has increasingly strong results. Meta Platforms (META) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for Meta Platforms is $597.50, which represents a -5.62% upside potential from today’s share price of $633.10. Of all the analysts covering META stock, it receives a consensus “Buy” rating with a score of 1.5, with 1 being the strongest “Buy” rating and 5 being the strongest “Sell” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s forecast projects Meta Platforms’ stock price to be $603 by the end of 2025, based on the company’s ability to sustain its strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency, which in turn will drive its bottom line despite capital expenditures increasing toward its AI objectives. Meta Platforms Price Estimates 2025-2030 Year Revenue Net Income EPS 2024 $161.579 $54.960 $21.18 2025 $183.459 $62.250 $24.12 2026 $205.257 $70.680 $27.71 2027 $226.332 $78.258 $30.42 2028 $245.319 $85.912 $32.38 2029 $268.306 $97.044 $36.54 2030 $274.947 $91.227 $39.70 Revenue and net income in $billions How META’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We estimate the price per share of Meta Platforms to be $692 with revenue jumping over $200 billion for the first time in 2026. EPS expectations are for $27.71 annualized. That stock forecast represents a gain of 11.74% over today’s share price. In 2027 we expect META’s stock price to reach $760 with net income increasing to $78 billion on the back of free cash flow exceeding $60 billion for the first time. That stock price represents a 22.72% increase over today’s share price. 24/7 Wall Street forecasts that META’s share price will reach $809 by the end of 2028, as free cash flow surpasses $70 billion. That price per share represents a 30.63% increase from where the stock is trading today. Then in 2029, we estimate that Meta Platforms will reach $79.262 billion in free cash flow, $97.044 billion in net income and over $268 in revenue resulting in a price per share of $914, or 47.58% upside potential from today’s share price. META’s Price Target for 2030 By the end of the start of the next decade, we forecast that META’s stock price will reach $995.00, or 60.66% higher than it is trading for today, despite estimates that net income will pull back slightly from over $97 billion to over $91 billion. Revenue growth will continue, with an estimated 2.48% year-over-year increase from 2029. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $530 -14.42 2025 $603 -2.64% 2026 $692 11.74% 2027 $760 22.72% 2028 $809 30.63% 2029 $914 47.58% 2030 $995 60.66% Revenue and net income in $billions “The Next NVIDIA” Could Change Your Life If you missed out on NVIDIA’s historic run, your chance to see life-changing profits from AI isn’t over.
