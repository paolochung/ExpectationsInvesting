MMM,2025-06-04 16:10:02,I have invested in dividends for 15 years—These are the foundations of my passive income plan,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/i-have-invested-in-dividends-for-15-yearsthese-are-20250604.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points These high-yield dividend stocks haven’t disappointed me in the last decade. Each of these stocks have the potential of an upside as the economy improves. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Ever since I started my investment journey, dividend stocks have remained a favorite, and for good reason. I enjoy the steady passive income and reinvest the dividends to keep the money growing. With hundreds of dividend-paying companies in the industry, it is possible to choose high-yield stocks that have a steady record of rewarding shareholders and an ability to sustain dividends, even in tough times. The stock market has shown volatility since the start of the year amid recession concerns and tariff uncertainty. I continue to choose stocks that provide safety and passive income. I’ve invested in these dividend stocks for 15 years and they have become a core part of my passive income plan. These companies can not only sustain the dividends but also increase them in the coming years. Here are my top picks. Johnson &amp; Johnson A dividend portfolio remains incomplete without Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). One of the top healthcare stocks, the company is an exceptional brand with a global presence and a unique product line. The company has a lineup of medicines across different areas including oncology, neuroscience, and immunology. It holds more than 10 drugs which generate about $1 billion in sales each year. In the first quarter, the company saw a 2.4% jump in sales to $21.9 billion and it has increased the full-year sales guidance. Its EPS stood at $4.54 and the majority of the sales were driven by the innovative medicine segment. Additionally, the company has an impressive pipeline of drugs which means the company will keep growing even if the revenue increases at a slower pace. It also has the pricing power to handle negotiations with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The company has increased dividends for 63 consecutive years and currently has a yield of approximately 3.1%. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been around for over a century and it has seen it all. The healthcare leader is known as a Dividend King for a reason. 3M Another top pick, 3M (NYSE:MMM) is a highly diversified business and provides services in multiple industries. The company has four segments, namely, transportation, healthcare, safety, and industrial and consumer. The company achieved an organic sales growth of 1.5% and an EPS of $1.88, up 10% year over year in the first quarter. It reported slower growth but the management is expecting better earnings in the coming quarters. 3M is focusing on operational improvements to turn around the business. Trading for $149, the stock is up 15% year-to-date and 51% in 12 months. Despite the weak sales environment and ongoing market volatility, 3M hasn’t disappointed investors. CEO Bill Brown has laid out several initiatives to turn the business around. He is focusing on revitalizing new product introductions, which could improve sales growth and margins. MMM enjoys a dividend yield of 1.97% and has increased dividends for 65 years. While the short-term outlook may not look attractive, 3M is for long-term investors and its dividends are worth watching out for. There is no doubt that the industry is operating in an environment that is highly volatile right now. However, if the economic outlook improves through the de-escalation of the trade conflict, 3M has the potential to see higher sales and revenue. Coca Cola The top beverage giant is a favorite of Warren Buffett and he holds over 400 million shares in the company. Coke (NYSE: KO) is a highly diversified business with the most valuable brands including Sprite, Minute Maid, Fanta, and Diet Coke. In the first quarter, Coca-Cola reported sales of $11.22 billion and an EPS of 73 cents. Despite a 2% drop in net sales, the company saw a 6% rise in organic revenue. The management has maintained the full-year forecast and expects the tariff disruptions to be manageable. Despite the tariffs, it is a well-shielded company that will keep paying you each quarter. The company has raised dividends for over six decades and enjoys a yield of 2.84%. It announced a 5.2% year-over-year rise in the quarterly per-share payout and the company has the ability to afford to keep paying dividends. KO stock is exchanging hands for $71 and is up 16% year-to-date. This is a solid dividend stock to buy under $100. The name, reliability, and the global presence make Coca-Cola a top dividend king to own. I have held Coca-Cola for over 15 years and I am nowhere near giving up on it. Procter &amp; Gamble One of the largest consumer products companies, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) has become a household name today. It is a leader in healthcare, beauty and grooming, and baby and family care. The company owns some of the biggest brands including Pampers, Gillette, Tide, Olay, and Pantene. Since it doesn’t rely on a particular country, brand, or category, it has a heavily diversified business that will keep generating revenue. It is in a better position to handle tariff-related issues and inflationary pressure. In the recently announced results, the company reported a 2% rise in net sales and a 3% jump in organic revenue. Its EPS came in at $1.88 and the management has reiterated the full-year outlook. Exchanging hands for $167, PG stock is flat year-to-date and up 2.8% in 12 months. The stock is far from cheap, it has a P/E ratio of 26.64, higher than its 10-year median of 25.7 but paying a premium for the stock might be worthwhile in an uncertain environment like today. The company has a dividend yield of 2.52% and it has increased dividends for 69 consecutive years. If you want to play super-safe, this is the Dividend king to own.

MMM,2025-05-02 10:15:00,Burn Care Market worth $3.35 billion by 2030 with 5.6% CAGR | MarketsandMarkets™,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/burn-care-market-worth-335-billion-by-2030-with-56-20250502.jpg,https://www.prnewswire.com,"DELRAY BEACH, Fla., May 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The global Burn Care Market, valued at US$2.46 billion in 2024, is forecasted to grow at a robust CAGR of 5.6%, reaching US$2.55 billion in 2025 and an impressive US$3.35 billion by 2030. This market is experiencing consistent growth due to several key factors. The number of burn injuries is rising due to factors such as industrial accidents, domestic fires, and other hazards. Furthermore, advancements in treatment technologies and increased awareness and education about burn care contribute to this trend. Additionally, supportive government initiatives play a significant role in market development. The demand for effective burn treatments is rising as the global population ages. Older individuals are more susceptible to slow-healing wounds and burn complications, which, in turn, increases the need for advanced burn care products. Moreover, technological advancements in burn treatment—including innovative burn dressings, biologics, and advanced burn wound assessment devices—enhance treatment efficiency and effectiveness. Download PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=247121470 Browse in-depth TOC on ""Burn Care Market"" 345 - Tables 45 - Figures 302 - Pages By Based on products, the burn care market is categorized into five segments: advanced burn dressings, burn wound therapy devices, biologics, traditional burn care products, and other burn care products. Among these, the biologics segment is expected to register the highest CAGR during the forecast period. This growth is driven by the rising demand for advanced and effective treatment options for deep and complex burns. Biologics provide targeted healing, minimize long-term complications, and promote tissue regeneration, making them particularly suitable for treating severe burns. The increasing acceptance of these products among healthcare professionals and ongoing innovations in regenerative medicine are contributing to the strong and sustained growth of the biologics segment. By Based on burn degree, the burn care market is divided into first-degree burns (minor burns), second-degree burns (partial-thickness burns), and third-degree burns (full-thickness burns). Of these, the second-degree burns segment accounted for the largest market share of the burn care market in 2024. This is largely because partial-thickness burns occur more frequently. These burns tend to destroy the epidermis and dermis; as such, they require the application of advanced burn care products, which drives consistent demand in this segment. By geography, the market for burn care is divided into five main regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America dominated the burn care market in 2024 with the largest market share. This is primarily because countries like the US and Canada have well-developed healthcare facilities, supporting widespread access to advanced burn care products and treatments. The region also experiences a high rate of burn injuries. The availability of key players and constant investment in research & development further consolidate North America's position in the burn care market.

Here are some of my biggest wins.",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/im-27-and-have-i-have-33000-in-a-20250313.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Retirement doesn&#8217;t have to be someone&#8217;s number-one priority as they get started on their professional journeys in their early-20s. That said, after one has settled into a new career, starting the retirement saving journey can put your head and shoulders above the crowd, as you aim to retire more comfortably. Furthermore, if you&#8217;re miles ahead in the game, perhaps the door to an early retirement (think the FIRE movements) could open, giving you more options as you shoot to achieve financial freedom. Of course, there are numerous early retirement success stories on Reddit, with a number of Millennials and Gen X&#8217;ers boasting nest eggs sizeable enough to retire well before the traditional (think Social Security-eligible age) finish line. Of course, an earlier retirement will be &#8220;leaner&#8221; (think less extravagant spending) than if you&#8217;d retired later. Either way, the key is staying ahead and taking advantage of any 401(k) matches an employer may offer. In this piece, we&#8217;ll explore the case of a 27-year-old who&#8217;s faring quite well, with $33,000 saved up in a Roth and close to $50,000 in the 401(k), comprising an impressive net worth of just north of the $100,000 mark. This relatively young over-achiever shared their biggest wins on Reddit. For the young readers striving to get ahead at a young age, here are the most important takeaways, at least in my view. Key Points This 27-year-old over-achiever is off to a hot start. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in their well-balanced $100k portfolio. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Keeping contributions consistent and investing in the steady blue-chips Having a look at their portfolio, it&#8217;s clear they&#8217;re not investing like many people in their age group. Indeed, someone in their late-20s would probably be likelier to speculate on the hot tech stock of the day in search of the next timely double. Instead, the Reddit user seems to have opted for &#8220;boring&#8221; stocks that, I believe, are more common in the portfolio of a much older investor (think a retiree). Indeed, investing with such a balanced approach at a young age can be a wise long-term move, given stocks don&#8217;t always go up — something many market newcomers discovered in the Trump 2.0 term. So, what&#8217;s at the core of their portfolio? First, there&#8217;s quite a bit of index funds in there, with low-cost S&amp;P 500 ETFs topping the list. Pretty solid blue chips make up the core of this portfolio With a bit of Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) sprinkled on top, the Reddit user has a nice balance of growth and stability. Looking further under the hood, we see some rock-solid blue-chip names like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) — staples for many retirees. However, it&#8217;s not all boring retiree-friendly stocks. The Reddit user has a mix of &#8220;growthier&#8221; Magnificent Seven names — like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) — to balance things out. Overall, it&#8217;s a very well-rounded and balanced portfolio that looks like it can hold up in this market hailstorm. As the market turns lower, here&#8217;s hoping the Reddit user adds to fallen positions on weakness. Indeed, the first $100,000 is just the start, as they embark on a multi-decade journey towards (early) retirement. Personally, I&#8217;d suggest adding more to index funds (S&amp;P 500 or the QQQ) on further weakness to simplify things. A correction has struck, making it a great time to top-up on low-cost index funds, especially since the market is moving faster than one can keep up with a rather long list of individual names. As for the other names, I&#8217;d encourage the investor to do their own homework and pare positions that have become overbought. For instance, 3M and CAT stand out as names that may make sense to take profits in. The bottom line This self-guided Reddit user acts as a great example for how new investors should go about beginning their retirement journeys. They&#8217;ve got a balanced portfolio and seem well-equipped to win at the long-term game! Though they&#8217;re a tad light on tech compared to most other young people, I do think they&#8217;re well-insulated from a bursting of an AI bubble — that is, if one even exists.The post I&#8217;m 27 and have I have $33,000 in a Roth and $48,000 in my 401K.
