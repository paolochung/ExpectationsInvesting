This change has occurred worldwide, most notably in technologically advanced countries like America. We once ventured out to &#8220;run errands&#8221;, a frequent activity that often included a stop at the mall or a trip to the local boutique. But with Amazon reigning supreme and tons of huge brands like Walmart and Target focusing on online sales, the nature of shopping in America has been drastically altered. With online retail comes the opportunity to reach any segment of the population from anywhere in the world. As competition skyrockets, brand recognition, marketing, and advertising become crucial to a company&#8217;s success. To find the 10 retail stores Americans love most, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the recent 2025 Axios Harris Poll 100 Reputation Rankings. This consumer survey ranked 100 brands, giving each a score. These were accessed across several categories, such as Character, Trust, Growth, Vision, and Ethics. Depending on the exact score, these brands fell into 6 separate rankings: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor. In the retail store category, 15 brands made Axios&#8217; list; however, only 10 of these fell into the top 3 rankings.

Five fascinating funds will tempt income seekers with potent yields and strong growth prospects. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Stock picking is fine, but exchange traded funds (ETFs) can enable immediate diversification without sacrificing growth and income opportunities. By selecting multiple funds instead of just one, you can achieve an extra measure of safety while also turning your portfolio into a veritable income-generating machine. The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/03/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-passive-income-machines/

You can try all four of these high-yield ETFs for diversified exposure to a wide range of stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In recent years, ultra-high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs) have opened the door to new possibilities for aggressive income harvesters. If you pick your ETFs carefully, you can practically turn your portfolio into a passive income machine. Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-passive-income-machines/

HD,2025-05-25 06:02:08,I have invested in dividends for 25 years—These stocks define my whole dividend strategy,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/i-have-invested-in-dividends-for-25-yearsthese-stocks-20250525.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points You can pack your portfolio with dividend payers to juice your returns over the long run. At the same time, the cornerstone of your strategy should be solid companies, not just the biggest yield. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) One huge lesson I&#8217;ve learned during the past quarter century is that time is a dividend investor&#8217;s best friend. It&#8217;s possible to build life-changing wealth if you pick stocks that represent solid businesses, accumulate shares, and consistently reinvest the dividends for many years. The secret sauce here isn&#8217;t to chase after stocks that pay the highest dividend yields. Rather, it&#8217;s getting good yield while also focusing on companies that are growing their sales, income, or both. Thus, I&#8217;ve developed a dividend investing strategy over the past 25 years that emphasizes financially firm businesses instead of gigantic yields. So, feel free to add these rock-solid dividend deliverers to your buy-and-hold portfolio today. Lockheed Martin (LMT) As long as we live in an uncertain world, there will always be a need for national defense infrastructure. Consequently, I&#8217;ve counted on Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock as a mainstay of my dividend-paying portfolio. Defense contractor Lockheed Martin is a financially solid company, I believe, because the company&#8217;s top-line and bottom-line results are moving in the right direction. Specifically, Lockheed Martin grew its first-quarter 2025 sales by 4% year over year to $17.963 billion and its net earnings by 10.8% to $1.712 billion. Unless you expect the world to live in complete peace and harmony, it makes sense to add some Lockheed Martin shares to your portfolio. Currently, the company offers a forward annual dividend yield of 2.79%. Imagine how those dividend distributions can enhance your wealth over time if you continue to reinvest them. Actually, you don&#8217;t have to imagine it because I&#8217;ll now use a historic dividend reinvestment returns calculator to show you what the results can look like. If you had invested $10,000 in Lockheed Martin stock at the beginning of the year 2000 and not reinvested the dividends, you would have grown it to $297,011.60. Yet, if you had reinvested the dividends over those 25 years, you would have grown your LMT stock investment to $441,649.89. Clearly, a minor adjustment to your strategy can make a huge difference over time. Coca-Cola (KO) What could possibly be more refreshing than an ice-cold soda from beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)? My answer would be: a distribution of cold, hard cash in your portfolio from Coca-Cola, a consistent dividend payer for many years. As a business, Coca-Cola has stayed financially reliable through good and bad times. For instance, in 2025&#8217;s first quarter (which included some broad-market volatility), Coca-Cola grew its organic revenue by 6% year over year and increased its earnings per share (EPS) by 5% to $0.77. What if you had invested $10,000 in KO stock at the beginning of this century? It would have been a good decision since, without reinvesting the dividends, that $10,000 would have turned into $35,271.43 by now. Reinvesting all of the dividend distributions would have been even better, though. That strategy would have grown your investment to $51,274.26, believe it or not. Today, Coca-Cola provides a 2.84% forward annual dividend yield, so don&#8217;t hesitate to take a sip of these delicious distributions in 2025. Dominion Energy (D) Throughout the ups and downs of the economy, people will undoubtedly continue to use electricity. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve counted on Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) to continue generating revenue and delivering dividend payments during the past 25 years. Dominion Energy is a large utilities company with a firm financial foothold. In Q1 of 2025, the company grew its operating revenue to $4.076 billion from $3.632 billion in the year-earlier quarter. In that same time frame, Dominion Energy increased its net income from $0.50 per share to $0.75 per share. Going back to the beginning of January 2000, a simple policy of holding Dominion Energy stock without reinvesting the dividends would have turned $10,000 to $58,013.69. That&#8217;s nothing to sneeze at, but if you had reinvested all of the dividends, that same $10,000 would have ballooned to $84,120.94. The historic returns have been amazing, but is it too late to electrify your returns with Dominion Energy stock in 2025? No way! If you want to try out my strategy of investing in financially solid businesses and reinvesting the cash distributions, feel free to purchase shares of Dominion Energy along with Lockheed Martin and Coca-Cola. While you&#8217;re at it, check out some other established dividend champions like Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) (with a forward annual dividend yield of 3.58%), Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) (4.08%), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (2.32%), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). With ultra-reliable names like these in your portfolio, you can look forward to a fantastic future of outstanding, dividend-driven returns.The post I have invested in dividends for 25 years—These stocks define my whole dividend strategy appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/05/23/i-have-invested-in-dividends-for-25-years-these-stocks-define-my-whole-dividend-strategy/

HD,2025-05-23 10:00:52,PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 (May 2025),https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/paypal-nasdaq-pypl-price-prediction-and-forecast-20252030-may-20250523.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) gained 16.64% over the past month, joining in the broad market&#8217;s rally that has been propelled by the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause between the U.S. and China. However, the stock is still struggling longer-term, with a year-to-date loss of 16.85% and a nearly 22% loss since hitting its one-year high on Jan. 17, 2025. Long before there was Venmo and Cash App, there was PayPal. The pioneer of online payments was founded in 1998 in San Jose, Calf. Four years later, it went public and was then acquired by eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) later in 2022. But in 2015, eBay spun the company off to its shareholders, and PayPal has been an independent company ever since. Since then, the company&#8217;s online payments services have exploded in popularity, with its market cap peaking at $356.75 billion in July 2021. That coincided with the stock reaching its all-time high of $308.53. However, the company has endured some growing pains since then, which have resulted in its market cap being reduced to the current $60.96 billion and shares having fallen more than -80% from their all-time high in July 2021. But for prospective investors looking for growth opportunity, PayPal sits in the midst of an industry undergoing explosive growth. According to Grand View Research, the global fintech service market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5% from 2023 to 2030. This expected industry growth bodes very well for shareholders. And despite the stock being down significantly from its all-time high, PayPal has gained 43.68% in 2024, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 over the same period. 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside potential for the fintech company before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect from PayPal over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Globally, the fintech service market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.5% from 2023 to 2030, and in the U.S. alone, that growth is forecast for 16.6% over the same time. PayPal isn&#8217;t simply processing payments between friends or businesses, but participating in a major shift that involves &#8220;fintech solution providers that consistently introduce novel technologies like AI, blockchain and data analytics, with the potential to reshape financial services and streamline operational effectiveness,&#8221; according to Grand View Research. Online payments is a segment seeing exponential growth, and that has translated into a series of successive earnings beats for PayPal, which are likely to continue as the company gains more market share. Payment service providers, or PSPs, are now being tasked with with expanded service demands, like fraud mitigation, improving collection processes and reconsidering markets where profitable growth may be possible but has previously exceeded most institutions’ risk appetite, such as the gaming industry, according to consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Co.

PayPal&#8217;s Recent Stock Success Since officially being spun off from eBay on July 10, 2015, shares of PayPal enjoyed an incredible run before hitting their all-time high in July 2021, gaining over 789%. That surge was largely fueled from the arrival of COVID-19, which saw a dramatic shift to online buying. From its pandemic low on $86.68 on March 20, 2020, the stock rewarded shareholders with gains of 256% over the subsequent six quarters. However, the end of the pandemic coupled with increased competition began to erode the company&#8217;s market share since, which has forced PayPal to begin diversifying its business segments in order to expand customer services and differentiate itself from newcomers like Stripe, Amazon Pay, Apple Pay and Square. Year Share Price Revenue* Net Income* 2015 $36.20 $9.192 $1.551 2016 $39.47 $10.839 $1.816 2017 $73.62 $12.983 $2.281 2018 $83.26 $15.460 $2.883 2019 $109.40 $17.750 $3.654 2020 $234.20 $21.418 $4.519 2021 $188.58 $25.349 $5.466 2022 $71.22 $27.500 $4.722 2023 $61.41 $29.614 $5.521 *Revenue and net income in $billions Since 2015 when PayPal was again a publicly traded company, its total annual revenue grew by more than 222% through 2023. However, the two aforementioned headwinds beginning in 2021 — increased competition and the end of the pandemic — saw its share price careen despite steadily increased revenue and consistent net income. At the same time, PayPal became mired in debt repayment, which jumped from $361 million in 2021 to $1.05 billion in 2023. Nonetheless, as the Silicon Valley fixture looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact PayPal’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of PayPal&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Demand for Digital Payments Is Exploding. Data from Statista indicates that digital payments from PSPs has exploded from $6.25 trillion in 2017 to $15.46 trillion in 2023 — a 147% increase. That figure is forecast to reach $36.75 trillion in 2029, $23.50 trillion of which will be made in mobile payments alone. PayPal&#8217;s seamless integration, which is used in 200 countries and regions and with 25 different currencies, is likely to face increased demand as merchants who rely on it look to capitalize on rapid customer onboarding and user-friendliness, both of which are expected to drive the digital payments market in the near and medium terms. The company is already well-positioned, with its digital financial network accounting for 220 million active customers each month, making it one of the world’s largest PSP in the world. 2. Strong Earnings and Revenue Has Continued. Despite the stock&#8217;s slide since midway 2021, PayPal has time and again posted strong quarterly earnings and revenue. Since the fourth quarter of 2020, the company has beat on earnings 16 out of 19 quarters. It is a similar story for reported quarterly revenue over that period. That has left the company with a healthy cash position, with free cash flow exploding in growth from $3.37 billion in 2019 to a current trailing 12-month (TTM) position of $6.71 billion. That is good for an increase of more than 99% in five years. 3. PayPal Credit and Buy Now, Pay Later Is Expanding the Company&#8217;s Breadth. Beyond being a PSP, PayPal has branched out to other business sectors that are likely to bolster revenue as they experience similar CAGRs: credit and buy now, pay later. These services are already offered at major retailers and online merchants, like Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD), Temu and eBay, for example. The site provides consumers with a line of revolving credit through Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF). In 2023, of PayPal&#8217;s nearly $30 billion in revenue, $27 billion came from transaction revenues, with PSP transactions representing more than 90% of the company&#8217;s total revenue. Meanwhile, revenues from its other business segments — including interest and fees through its credit offerings — were over $2.91 billion, which represented roughly 9% of the company&#8217;s revenue. However, Grand View Research projects the buy now, pay later industry to undergo CAGR of 24.3% from 2023 to 2030, meaning this business segment for PayPal could see its revenue growth outpace the company&#8217;s traditional PSP offerings by the end of this decade. PayPal (PYPL) Stock Prediction in 2025 The current median one-year price target for PayPal is $82.48, representing upside potential of 15.13% over the next 12 months from its current share price. Of the 33 analysts covering PayPal, the stock receives a consensus rating of &#8220;Moderate Buy,&#8221; with 15 analysts assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 16 assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and two assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s forecast for shares of PYPL is $81.15, good for 13.27% upside potential based on an annualized EPS estimate of $4.93 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio estimate of 16. PayPal (PYPL) Stock Forecast 2025–2030 Year Revenue* EPS 2025 $33.663 $4.93 2026 $36.048 $5.44 2027 $39.631 $6.96 2028 $42.668 $7.37 2029 $48.195 $8.09 2030 $52.076 $9.59 *Revenue in $billions PayPal&#8217;s (PYPL) Price Target for 2025–2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates PayPal&#8217;s stock to be trading for $134.26 per share, representing a 73.80% increase from its current price, based on revenue of $52.076 billion and an annualized EPS of $9.59.

The cloud-based AI data storage company is largely expected to come through with flying colors. Firms like Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and Evercore ISI are all expecting Snowflake to outperform considering its resilience throughout the tariff era. Jefferies analysts aren&#8217;t wasting any time and have already raised their price target on the stock to $200 per share, reflecting 20.8% upside potential. The markets remain under pressure, including a 0.23% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. S&amp;P 500 Earnings Outlook 11:02 am by Gerelyn Terzo Most of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported Q1 earnings already, and according to Factset data, the results are largely impressive. Of the companies that have reported already, over three-quarters (78%) of S&amp;P 500 companies have revealed a positive EPS surprise, while more than half (62%) of them have surprised to the upside on revenue. Nevertheless, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that Wall Street earnings estimates on S&amp;P 500 companies have further to fall amid persistent tariff uncertainty. Improved Market Sentiment 9:55 am by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America published a report revealing that sentiment around the broader stock market has improved, with its equity risk-love indicator flipping from deep panic last month to a neutral reading most recently. If history is any indication, this improvement suggests stocks could soon revisit their record-high levels, despite today&#8217;s lackluster performance. The Nasdaq Composite is currently down 0.48%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets came out of the gate lower across the board this morning after managing to eke out slight gains yesterday. Yesterday&#8217;s market performance marked the sixth straight day of gains for the S&amp;P 500, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also moved higher. After Moody&#8217;s cut the U.S. debt rating by one notch, Deutsche Bank weighed in saying the U.S. economy is &#8220;suffering death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; The Wall Street firm&#8217;s Jim Reid wrote, &#8220;Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is one of the gainers, rising 3% and helping to offset losses in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. CEO Elon Musk has committed to staying at the helm for the next five years. Dow stock Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has no plans to pass along tariff-related costs to customers, unlike fellow Dow component Walmart&#8217;s (NYSE: WMT), which had earlier plans to do so. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 50.53 (-0.12%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 81.77 (-0.43%) S&amp;P 500: Down 19.17 (-0.33%) Market Movers Quantum stocks have captured the spotlight after D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) skyrocketed as much as 20% following the release of its newest quantum computing system. The company&#8217;s Advantage2 system is officially available via the cloud, representing its most powerful quantum offering to date, featuring greater energy and lower noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is tacking on 3.3% today as it climbs closer to its 52-week high level. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is shaving off 3.2% of its value today.

Expectations are largely high, anticipating a strong performance from the company. Analyst firms such as Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, and Evercore ISI are all forecasting an outperformance for Snowflake, citing its demonstrated resilience even amid the recent tariff challenges. Jefferies analysts, in particular, have already taken action, boosting their price target on the stock to $200 per share, indicating a potential 20.8% upside. This sense of bullishness comes as the broader markets remain under pressure, including a 0.24% decline in the SPY ETF. Earnings Roundup 11:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first-quarter earnings season still unfolding, the performance of most S&amp;P 500 companies has proven notably robust. FactSet data illustrates this strength: a significant 78% of reporting S&amp;P 500 firms delivered a positive earnings per share (EPS) surprise, and over half (62%) also exceeded revenue forecasts. Despite these strong results, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sounded a cautionary note, suggesting that Wall Street&#8217;s current earnings estimates for S&amp;P 500 companies may still need to be adjusted downward amidst ongoing tariff uncertainty. The SPY ETF remains lower by 0.26% as of late morning trading. BofA: Stock Market Sentiment Is Looking Up 10:29 am by Gerelyn Terzo A recent report from Bank of America indicates a notable shift in broader stock market sentiment. The firm&#8217;s equity risk-love indicator has now transitioned from a state of deep panic recorded last month to a neutral reading in its latest assessment. Historically, such an improvement often signals that stocks may soon retest their previous record-high levels. The SPY ETF is currently down a slight 0.30%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets opened on a subdued note across the board this morning, with all three of the major stock market averages edging lower. If the S&amp;P 500 can turn it around like it did yesterday, it will mark its seventh-straight winning session for the broader market index. The SPY ETF remains lower by a slight 0.30%. After Moody&#8217;s cut the U.S. debt rating by one notch, Deutsche Bank responded with its assessment that the U.S. economy is experiencing a &#8220;death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds. Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Jim Reid wrote, “Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.” Despite the broader market&#8217;s struggles, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is an outlier, climbing 3% and offering some counterweight to the losses seen in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. Tesla boss Elon Musk vowed to remain at the helm of the EV maker for the next five years. On the Dow, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has indicated it won&#8217;t pass tariff-related costs onto consumers, a different approach compared to fellow Dow component Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which had earlier signaled price increases. Here’s a look at the performance as of mid-morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 98.87 (-0.23%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 95.66 (-0.49%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.48 (-0.33%) Market Movers Quantum computing stocks are capturing attention. D-Wave Quantum (Nasdaq: QBTS) surged as much as 20% this morning after launching its newest quantum computing system. The company&#8217;s Advantage2 system, now accessible via the cloud, represents its most powerful offering yet, boasting enhanced energy efficiency and reduced noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is adding 3.3% to its value today, nearing its 52-week high. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is shedding 3.2% of its value, and Airbnb (Nasdaq: ABNB) is down 3.1% following an order from Spain to delist tens of thousands of short-term rental properties.

Among those that have already reported, more than three-quarters (78%) of S&amp;P 500 companies posted a positive EPS surprise, while close to two-thirds (62%) also beat their revenue projections. This positive trend, however, is tempered by a warning from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who cautions that Wall Street&#8217;s earnings estimates on S&amp;P 500 companies have further to decline given persistent tariff uncertainty. The SPX ETF remains lower by 0.42%. Stock Market Outlook: BofA 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Bank of America, investor sentiment regarding the wider stock market has seen an uptick. The Wall Street firm&#8217;s equity risk-love indicator, which showed deep panic just last month, has most recently registered a neutral position. Should the pattern persist, this positive change suggests that equities could soon move to challenge their all-time highs. The SPX ETF remains lower by 0.35%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets began the day on a weaker footing today, largely giving back the slight advances seen yesterday. Yesterday&#8217;s session was notable for extending the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s winning streak to six straight days, with both the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also moving into positive territory. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.35% as of mid-morning trading. Moody&#8217;s downgraded the U.S. debt rating, prompting Deutsche Bank to declare the U.S. economy is experiencing a &#8220;death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; But the outlook also suggests the U.S. economy is at the tail end of that downward spiral. Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid wrote in a note, “Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.” Amidst the overall declines, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stands out, gaining 3% and helping to cushion the drops in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. Dow component Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has signaled it won&#8217;t be passing on tariff-related expenses to customers, a contrasting strategy to Walmart (NYSE: WMT), another Dow component, which had previously indicated such plans before the White House urged them otherwise. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 58.88 (-0.14%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 59.95 (-0.31%) S&amp;P 500: Down 12.18 (-0.20%) Market Movers The quantum computing sector is making headlines, driven by D-Wave Quantum (Nasdaq: QBTS), which saw its shares jump by up to 20%. This surge follows the release of its latest quantum computing system, the Advantage2, now available through the cloud. The company highlights this as its most potent quantum offering to date, featuring improved energy performance and lower operational noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is up 3.3% and inching closer to its 52-week high. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is losing 3.2% of its value. Airbnb (Nasdaq: ABNB) is down 3.1% after Spanish authorities mandated the removal of numerous short-term rental listings.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values. He said at an event in New York, “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think” they can&#8230;“My own view is people feel pretty good because you haven’t [yet] seen effective tariffs&#8230;The market came down 10%, [it’s] back up 10%; that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.&#8221; Ray Dalio Comments on US Debt 11:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, reportedly raised a flag that Moody&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating misses a crucial point regarding the vulnerability of U.S. Treasuries. According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18. Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a significant gainer, soaring 25.9% following regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares are lower by 4.4% on the back of an analyst downgrade. Take-Two Interactive Software (Nasdaq: TTWO) is bucking the trend, climbing 3.7% after a price target increase from Wedbush Securities.

HD,2025-05-05 12:02:06,I’m curious about dividend investing – What age and allocations are others using?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/im-curious-about-dividend-investing-what-age-and-allocations-20250505.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Dividend investing may be more favored by older investors who value passive income over growth and capital appreciation. However, investing in dividend payers can be a wise move, regardless of one&#8217;s age. Arguably, it&#8217;s better to go for the proven blue chips with dividends as a beginning investor than jump into the deep end with incredibly volatile but exciting growth stocks. When it comes to hot growth stocks, the stakes are higher, and a new investor may be more inclined to &#8220;chase&#8221; momentum and be startled out of a position when such momentum reverses. In any case, there&#8217;s really no right age to take on more of a dividend strategy. Ultimately, it depends on one&#8217;s needs, goals, and tolerance for risk. Most young people should be in growth mode as they look to maximize the appreciation of their nest eggs. And while dividends can be a nice-to-have for such new, young investors, it&#8217;s worth noting that a dividend strategy isn&#8217;t always the most tax-efficient way to go. Additionally, a dividend-focused strategy is not a proven way to beat the markets consistently over the long haul. A t the end of the day, more money paid out in dividends means less for a company to reinvest into its growth drivers. Often, lower growth means higher dividend yields, and vice versa. Though some exceptions can be made during the depths of a stock market correction or crash. In this piece, we&#8217;ll look at common approaches among investors in different age groups to help readers better find the right allocation. Key Points Younger investors should favor growth over yield while gradually transitioning as they age and their passive income needs grow. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Younger investors: Go for growth Young investors in their 20s and 30s should seek to have a heavier allocation towards the types of growth stocks that have little (or no) dividends. Indeed, we&#8217;re talking about yields south of the 1% mark. And while a few extra dollars in dividend income are nice to have, one must remember that any such dividends should be reinvested anyhow to jolt one&#8217;s growth. In any case, I think it makes less sense to have more than 25% of one&#8217;s equity portfolio in high-yielding dividend stocks unless there&#8217;s some specific passive income need that needs to be met. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which yields 0.84%, stands out as a perfect holding for a younger investor who prioritizes capital gains over dividends. And while the yield is quite small, I am a fan of the dividend growth trajectory as the company executes on the AI boom. With around 30% of code reportedly now generated by AI, at least according to CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft seems to have the perfect AI flywheel that could power it to robust gains over the long haul. Middle-aged investors: Go for dividend growth For someone in middle age, opting for a dividend and growth mix seems to make the most sense. Whether that entails 50% in dividend stocks and 50% in higher-growth names, finding the right balance as one begins the process of winding down in their 40s and 50s for a potentially early retirement could prove wise. Additionally, dividend-growth stocks that have a long history of raising dividends by double-digit percentage amounts in any given year could be an excellent choice. For instance, shares of the Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stand out as a stellar option, given its robust dividend and respectable growth profile. The home improvement firm has a wide moat surrounding its corner of the market, which has allowed it to average around 15% in dividend growth over the past five years. With a solid 2.56% dividend yield and above-average dividend growth prospects, HD stock stands out as a perfect bet for dividend investors in their 40s or 50s. Retirement age: Doubling down on passive income Finally, someone in retirement may wish to go heavier on the dividend stocks. While it may still be hard to live off dividends alone, I do think that those with enough passive income streams (think pensions, Social Security, etc) may have the opportunity to minimize the withdrawal from their invested principal. For such income-focused retirees, the iShares International Select Dividend ETF (IDV) stands out, with a nice 5.6% yield and broad exposure to the developed international markets beyond the U.S. Also, as the tariff war continues, the international financial markets may not have as much downside risk as the S&amp;P 500.

With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it’s concerning that this isn’t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it’s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy’s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I’m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You’ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster’s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One’s layout is far easier to navigate, but it’s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn’t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache.

Gordon Plaza was developed in 1973 and is largely vacant, with the exception of the Aldi grocery store. The Home Depot Store will include a garden center with a nursery, motor vehicle rentals and curbside pickup. Woodbridge District Supervisor Margaret Franklin said the new use for Gordon Plaza will serve the North Woodbridge community well. ""If you're familiar with the shopping center, it is in great need of repairs,"" said Franklin. ""I just want to thank Kimco for stepping up and saying that they want to help revitalize this area and really beautify it. It's going to go really beautifully with the rest of the work we're doing in North Woodbridge to revitalize our corridor.""",https://www.patch.com/virginia/woodbridge-va/home-depot-approved-gordon-plaza-revitalization-woodbridge
