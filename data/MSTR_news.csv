MSTR,2025-06-03 10:04:43,"These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-20250603.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, and MSTY offer eye-catching yields for ambitious passive income investors. You can try all four of these high-yield ETFs for diversified exposure to a wide range of stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In recent years, ultra-high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs) have opened the door to new possibilities for aggressive income harvesters. If you pick your ETFs carefully, you can practically turn your portfolio into a passive income machine. Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-passive-income-machines/

Great Expectations 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo A cautious tone persists in today&#8217;s trading, with the three major stock market averages slightly in the red. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) shares are up 0.33% ahead of its highly anticipated quarterly earnings report expected after the closing bell. The prevailing sentiment is that Nvidia will once again exceed expectations and upgrade its guidance due to strong AI and chip demand. Yet, concerns linger regarding a potential write-down linked to China revenues, even with overall strong demand. The SPY ETF is lower by 0.16%. Consumer Spending on Deck 10:49 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive greater insight on the resilience of the consumer this week. Personal Income and Spending data for April is due out on Friday. This data follows a period of robust consumer spending observed in March. Economists at Wells Fargo anticipate a 0.3% increase in personal income and a 0.2% rise in personal spending. SPY is currently lower by 0.24%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets are treading carefully today, following yesterday&#8217;s powerful surge driven by news of EU import tariff delays. The spotlight is now firmly on corporate earnings, particularly those of chip giant Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), whose highly anticipated quarterly results are due after the market closes. Early morning trading shows stocks with minimal direction, as the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all registering modest gains. The SPY ETF is down 0.11% as of mid-morning trading. Here&#8217;s a look at the SPY over the past five trading sessions: The &#8220;Magnificent Seven&#8221; stocks are largely flat, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) up 1% and the rest of the cohort seeing mixed trading. GameStop (NYSE: GME) has dipped 3.5% today after venturing into the cryptocurrency space with its initial bitcoin acquisition exceeding $500 million, mirroring moves by MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has offloaded some TSLA shares while increasing its stake in Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings announcement. Elon Musk attempted to soothe investor concerns by posting about his relentless work schedule. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 22.97 (-0.05%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 9.71 (-0.05%) S&amp;P 500: Down 2.27 (-0.04%) Market Movers Retailer Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) is down 2.7% today, having cut its profit outlook amidst tariff-related challenges and cautious consumer sentiment. Conversely, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) is surging by 25.9% after easily beating its first-quarter earnings estimates. Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY), an electric air taxi firm, has climbed 26% following a $250 million strategic investment from automaker Toyota Motor. After initially rising above $127 per share, identity management company Okta (Nasdaq: OKTA) is now down 12% in the wake of its quarterly results, experiencing profit-taking. Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE: FICO) is recovering recent losses and is up 6.8% today.

Biotech Benefits from Generative AI 2:02 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Jefferies believes certain biotechnology stocks are poised to benefit from AI advancements. Analyst Michael Yee told CNBC that the sector is likely to save billions of dollars as well as time in getting drugs to market thanks to the role of generative AI in drug discovery. The firm is bullish on biotech stocks for the rest of 2025, saying any bad news is already built into the sector. The Nasdaq Composite is basically flat ahead of Nvidia&#8217;s earnings. Market Update 12:33 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks are continuing to play it safe in today&#8217;s trading session, with the three major stock market averages fractionally lower across the board. VP JD Vance is headlining today&#8217;s Bitcoin 2025 event, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift the BTC price, which is up about 0.17%. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock is up 0.33% today ahead of its quarterly earnings report due out this afternoon. The markets have come to expect Nvidia beating expectations and raising its guidance on strong AI and chip demand. Demand has been strong, but one area of concern is a write-down tied to China revenues. The Nasdaq Composite is currently down 0.09%. Personal Income &amp; Spending Preview 10:38 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive another dose of economic data on Friday when the Personal Income and Spending report for the month of April is released. The report will come on the heels of strong consumer spending in March. Wells Fargo economists forecast personal income growth of 0.3% and personal spending to rise 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.18%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are playing it cautious following yesterday&#8217;s strong rally fueled by EU import tariff delays. Today all eyes are on corporate America, more specifically semiconductor leader Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), which reports its highly anticipated quarterly results after the closing bell. Stocks are showing little conviction in early morning trading, with the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posting fractional gains. The Magnificent Seven stocks are little changed, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) posting a 1% gain and the rest of the group trading mixed. GameStop (NYSE: GME) is down 3.5% on the day after expanding its footprint into the cryptocurrency markets with its maiden bitcoin purchase worth over $500 million, taking a page from the books of MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has unloaded some TSLA shares while buying more Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings report. Elon Musk attempted to reassure investors by posting that he is working around the clock. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 54.20 (+0.13%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 43.57 (+0.23%) S&amp;P 500: Up 9.99 (+0.17%) Market Movers Retailer Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) is down 2.7% today after slashing its profit forecast amid tariff-related headwinds and consumer skittishness. On the flip side, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) is soaring by 25.9% after handily surpassing Q1 earnings estimates. Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY), an electric air taxi company, is up 26% after receiving a $250 million strategic investment from automaker Toyota Motor. After the stock initially climbed above $127 per share, Identity management company Okta (Nasdaq: OKTA) is experiencing a 12% decline on the heels of its quarterly results amid profit taking.

On April 7, 2025, Strategy disclosed that, following its adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08 (“ASU 2023-08”), which requires publicly traded companies to measure their crypto assets at fair value in their financial statements, it recognized a $5.91 billion unrealized loss on its digital assets for the first quarter 2025. The Company warned that it “may not be able to regain profitability in future periods, particularly if [it] incur[s] significant unrealized losses related to [its] digital assets.” On this news, Strategy’s stock price fell $25.47, or 8.7%, to close at $268.14 per share on April 7, 2025, thereby injuring investors. Then, on May 1, 2025, Strategy released its first quarter 2025 financial results, confirming that it had recorded an unrealized fair value loss on digital assets of approximately $5.9 billion due to applying a fair value accounting methodology to Strategy’s bitcoin assets following bitcoin’s depreciation in value during the first quarter of 2025.

MSTR,2025-05-20 13:35:13,Elon Musk says he will cut back on political spending after heavily backing Trump in 2024,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/elon-musk-says-he-will-cut-back-on-political-spending-20250520.png,https://www.marketscreener.com,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key financial supporter of President Donald Trump, said Tuesday that he'll be spending “a lot less” on political campaigns, a reversal that could be a setback for Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Musk disclosed his decision via videoconference during a Bloomberg forum in Doha, Qatar. It speaks to his possible disenchantment with politics after his tumultuous tenure as Trump's pick to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which has fallen far short of its goals for reducing federal spending. Musk has scaled back his government role to spend more time at his businesses, including Tesla, which have seen intense blowback. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); “In terms of political spending I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk said. Asked why, he responded that “I think I’ve done enough.” Musk's statement marks a reversal of the course he had set during the 2024 campaign — when he was among the very top political spenders — and immediately after. Musk spent at least $250 million supporting Trump in the presidential campaign, as the main contributor to America PAC, a super PAC that was active in advertising and funding door-to-door canvassing groups across the seven most-competitive states in the November presidential election. Musk relished in the publicity, campaigning alongside Trump at times and headlining some of his own campaign rallies on the GOP nominee's behalf. And while he took credit for helping Trump return to the White House, Musk suffered a public defeat in April, after he became deeply involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign. Musk-backed groups America PAC and Rebuilding America's Future spent more than $21 million on the April 1 election in support of the Republican-backed candidate Brad Schimel. But Schimel's defeat by 10 percentage points in Wisconsin, a state Trump carried just five months earlier, was a blow to Musk, who campaigned for Schimel in Green Bay the weekend before the election and had also pledged to enforce Trump's agenda in the 2026 midterm elections. A week after Trump's November victory, Musk said the political action committees he supported would “play a significant role in primaries,” adding later that he might help finance Republican challengers to GOP members of Congress who did not support Trump's nominees. “How else? There is no other way,” Musk wrote on X, which he rebranded after purchasing Twitter, in response to the suggestion of supporting intraparty challenges. An adviser to Musk’s PACs declined to comment Tuesday. Once Trump took office, Musk held a prominent role as an adviser and leader of DOGE. He and his acolytes in the department fanned out widely across the federal government to enact deep cuts to the workforce and spending, in some cases seeking to shutter entire agencies altogether. DOGE has pushed to fire tens of thousands of workers in downsizing at agencies, ranging from the IRS to Health and Human Services, and pressured tens of thousands more to take buyout and early retirement offers. And they sought to shut down agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. With backing from DOGE, agencies have cancelled tens of thousands of government contracts and grants that they say do not align with the administration’s priorities. Some of those moves were done so quickly that they had to be reversed after pushback or court rulings finding that they were illegal. Critics say it amounts to a reckless chain-saw approach that could destroy much of the nation’s apolitical civil service, impair services for vulnerable populations, and halt critical research. DOGE claims on its “Wall of Receipts” it has saved an estimated $170 billion, but those savings numbers have been shown to be flawed and inflated in many cases. Musk's role prompted intense pushback, including protests at his electric vehicle company, Tesla. Speaking to reporters earlier this month as he prepared to step back from DOGE, Musk noted the backlash. “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun,” he said. “Seeing cars burning is not fun,” he added, referring to the instances of Tesla cars being smashed or set on fire. Musk's announced intention to step back from political spending comes during multiple new business opportunities, including a deal to host the latest versions of his Grok artificial intelligence chatbot on Microsoft’s data centers. Meanwhile, his brain-computer interface company Neuralink is planning to implant its experimental devices in dozens more people and his electric-vehicle company Tesla is developing a humanoid robot that Musk hopes to one day send to Mars. Musk could change his mind about campaign spending. The 2026 midterm campaigns are just getting off the ground, while some candidates have not yet announced their candidacy for elections that remain 18 months away. But as of Tuesday, Musk said he did not expect to. “Well, if I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,"" Musk said. ""I do not currently see a reason.” ————————————————————————————————— Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa. Foley reported from Iowa City, Iowa.

Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could throw a wrench into the central bank&#8217;s efforts to tame inflation and spur economic growth. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy in the meantime. The Nasdaq Composite is spiraling 4% lower, weighed down by a 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA) and other Big Tech names on the tariff fallout. All sectors of the economy are lower with the exception of energy, which is up 1% as a group. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 847.60 (-2.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 713.07 (-4.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 161.77 (-3%) Gainers in a Sea of Red 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While the markets are a sea of red, including a 2.1% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, there are some gainers if you dig deep enough. We found a few, including: eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is up 2.5% on the day and is inching closer to its 52-week high of approximately $71 per share. The online auction platform could be gaining from a newly announced partnership with Checkout.com for payments. Bitcoin stock MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is tacking on 1.2% today while the bitcoin price continues to hover below the $85,000 level. On its best day, bitcoin serves as an inflationary hedge from the economy, which stands to benefit MSTR stock. Expand Energy (Nasdaq: EXE) is gaining 1.7% as a rising energy sector lifts those boats. Tariff Fallout 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, with the three major stock market averages stuck in a rut. While March retails sales rose a higher than expected 1.4%, the markets are obsessed with Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA), which warned that it will take a massive $5.5 billion charge for processor exports to China, giving the markets their &#8216;I told you so&#8217; moment. Magnificent Seven stocks are each down in the ballpark of 2% this morning, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), whose market cap has dipped below the $3 trillion threshold. The markets are under pressure out of the gate despite stronger than anticipated economic data. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red, including a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, which is being weighed down by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA). On the flip side, Applied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) is gaining 5% today, bucking the otherwise downward trend, on the heels of its fiscal Q3 results. Despite missing Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, Applied Digital is benefiting from its roll in data center infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing, two white-hot tech trends. The gold price is rising 2.4% today to $3,319.30 per ounce as investors flock to the inflationary hedge during these times of heightened uncertainty. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is gaining 4% on the day as a beneficiary of the gold rush. The technology sector is being dragged lower by NVDA stock after the company revealed an upcoming $5.5 billion charge related to chip exports to China, igniting trade war selling once again. Nvidia shares are sinking 5.6% today. Most sectors of the economy are down, including a 2.4% decline for technology, while energy stocks are up by 1%. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks is lower today. Retail sales grew by 1.4% in March, stronger than the expected 1.2% increase and providing yet another sign of a resilient U.S. consumer. Results excluding auto sales also beat economist projections, coming in at 0.5% vs. estimates of 0.3% even in the face of tariff uncertainty targeting the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 165.73 (-0.41%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 292.95 (-1.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 47.89 (-0.90%) Market Movers BofA analysts have reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Nvidia stock, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift sentiment in shares today. The Wall Street firm also lowered their price target on NVDA to $160 from $200 per share, blaming tariff uncertainty. Oppenheimer analysts have begun coverage on new stock Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Piper Sandler likes Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock, reiterating its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the EV maker while lowering the price target from $450 to $400 per share.

The Nasdaq Composite is leading the charge with a 1.8% advance, followed by the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which are up 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. China is apparently ready to come to the negotiating table on tariffs, infusing optimism into an otherwise confused stock market today. The Nasdaq Composite is being led by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) and Apple Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT) today. At the current pace, the Nasdaq Composite is looking at a 7% gain for the week, giving it a year-to-date advance of about 3%. Whipsaw Trading 12:18 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are seeing green as of early afternoon trading in what has been a whipsaw trading session for investors. All three of the major stock market indices are now seeing green, but there is a lack of conviction in either direction today. The Nasdaq Composite is being lifted by stocks like Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Linde (Nasdaq: LIN), with gains of 3% and 2%, respectively. While the latest wholesale price data shows inflation is waning, policymakers aren&#8217;t convinced. NY Fed official John Williams predicts economic growth will slow to a mere 1% in 2025, blaming tariffs for what he expects could result in 4% inflation by year-end. Stocks Flip Green 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo As of mid-morning trading, the stock market has turned higher, with all three of the major stock market averages now seeing green. Most sectors of the economy are now trading higher, led by materials and technology, each of which are up about 1%. The economy is still uncertain, but inflation is headed in the right direction &#8211; lower. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned on CNBC that a recession might have already reared its head in the U.S. economy. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand at last check: Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 198.68 (+0.48%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 129.17 (+0.79%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.31 (+0.40%) The markets remain fearful, falling modestly at the open across the board amid what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called a turbulent economy. Dimon also warned that S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates are going to be revised downward as corporate American continues to cancel their current outlooks, some of which have already begun to do so. He expects that American banks will be in the crosshairs of the trade wars. Markets are also weighing some better than expected economic data on the inflationary front. Wholesale price declined by 0.4% last month, yet another indication of waning inflation as the Federal Reserve gears up for its May meeting on interest rates. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 305.83 (-0.77%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 78.09 (-0.44%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.54 (-0.66%) Market Movers It&#8217;s a tale of two markets for the chip stocks today. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is falling a steep 8.9% to about its 52-week low level. The stock was trading in the $200 area last month to currently hover at $142 per share. On the flip side, Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 4.3% today to nearly $94 per share. The stock was well over $100 per share in recent weeks and has been volatile. Earnings season has begun. Financial stock Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reported better-than-expected Q1 profit results, sending shares up about 1%. The company&#8217;s results were fueled by robust stock market trading, leading to a record performance in that business. Advertising technology company AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) shares are under pressure today, falling 6% to below $250 per share as the tug-of-war in that stock continues to unfold. Bitcoin bull MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is rising 5% on the day alongside a rising BTC price.

MSTR,2025-03-27 11:39:55,Here’s What’s Driving Bitcoin’s March Higher,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/heres-whats-driving-bitcoins-march-higher-20250327.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"The bitcoin price is little changed at last check and is down 1.2% over the past 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency is up just over 3% in the past seven-day stretch but a better 10%-plus since its March bottom in the ballpark of $76,000. Investors might need to look at the BTC price through a slightly wider lens to appreciate its march higher this month. Meanwhile, bitcoin rival &#8211; precious metal gold &#8211; continues to hit new all-time highs above the $3,000 per ounce threshold. Gold is acting like the portfolio diversifier and inflationary hedge that it was designed to be. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been more sensitive to the same market headwinds that are haunting stocks, including inflation, tariff uncertainty and worries of an economic recession. The bitcoin price remains 20% below its all-time high reached in early 2025 of just over $109,000 per BTC. Key Points The bitcoin price is little changed at the moment and has fallen 1.2% in the past 24 hours. The very same headwinds that are holding back the stock market appear to be limiting BTC to its current range. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. Bitcoin Catalysts While bitcoin has its own monetary policy, including a supply limit of 21 million coins, the biggest crypto can still be swayed by what is going on with central banks. For example, BlackRock&#8217;s digital asset head Robert Mitchnick reportedly believes an economic recession in the U.S. would be a positive catalyst for the bitcoin price. If a recession were to rear its head, the Federal Reserve would likely pivot to more dovish monetary policy on interest rates. Video game retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME) reportedly has plans to add bitcoin to its balance sheet, taking a page out of the books of early movers like Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR). GameStop, the stock that was at the center of the WallStreetBets-fueled rally in 2021, plans to direct its cash flow toward acquiring bitcoins in the hopes of riding the cryptocurrency&#8217;s eventual rise higher. Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, whose company he founded has been adding bitcoin aggressively, welcomed GameStop Ryan Cohen to what he called &#8220;Team Bitcoin.&#8221; While all the excitement has sparked a rally in the GME stock, it has failed to lift the bitcoin price higher today. Now What? Bitcoin bulls are coming out of the woodwork on expectations that another bull cycle is up ahead for the cryptocurrency. By looking at the BTC price through a wider lens, it&#8217;s clear to see it&#8217;s having a good March despite hovering below its record high price. When the bitcoin price decides to break out further remains to be seen, but companies like GameStop and asset managers like BlackRock are betting it eventually will.The post Here&#8217;s What&#8217;s Driving Bitcoin&#8217;s March Higher appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/03/26/heres-whats-driving-bitcoins-march-higher/

President Trump plans to host cryptocurrency executives at the White House on Friday, a crypto summit that could offer new insight into the administration’s agenda regarding digital assets. The event's attendees are expected to include the CEOs of Coinbase (COIN), Crypto.com, Robinhood (HOOD), crypto wallet provider Exodus (EXOD), and the chair of bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, according to Trump's AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks. Trump is expected to speak at the event. He last weekend said the U.S. could launch a strategic crypto reserve composed of bitcoin and four other tokens. Such a reserve would “elevate this critical industry,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, “I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.” The price of bitcoin surged in the wake of Trump's election, rising from below $70,000 on election day to more than $109,000 the week of his inauguration. In recent weeks, however, the price has dropped as economic uncertainty has tempered risk appetite in financial markets. It recently traded a bit below $91,000. Trump has cultivated a pro-crypto image and named crypto-friendly figures to positions within key departments in his administration. He has also participated in the crypto business. Shortly before taking office, the president-elect and First Lady Melania Trump launched meme coins. Trump and his sons have also promoted World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project co-founded by Trump's envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff.

After coming out of the gate higher, stocks have since reversed course, with all three of the major stock market indices trading in the red, dragged lower by a 5% slide in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock. There are also some standout gainers. Among them is Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) rising nearly 3% this morning and recapturing the $300 per share level. Wall Street is helping the stock, with Morgan Stanley analysts calling it a “top pick” among auto stocks with a $430 price target attached, reflecting 43% upside potential. Elon Musk’s net worth now hovers at a reported $351 billion. Palantir (Nasdaq: PLTR) is rising over 5% today to nearly $90 per share. Once again, analysts have set the bullish tone, suggesting that Palantir is poised to benefit from government contract momentum despite recent headlines of defense department budget cuts. Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) is extending positive momentum on news of its upcoming standalone AI app to go head-to-head with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini in 2025.

Nvidia stock is weighing on the Nasdaq. Tesla and Palantir are bright spots, both recapturing recently lost ground. Other Market Movers MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is another bright spot, rising 4.5% on the Bitcoin rally, owing to the company’s heavy BTC holdings on its balance sheet. The Bitcoin price has been rallying on news of a new crypto reserve being introduced by the Trump administration which will hold BTC, among other digital assets. At $269, MSTR stock is still a far cry from its 52-week high of $543 per share. T-Mobile (Nasdaq; TMUS) is gaining 1.4% on the day on reports of a partnership with AI phenomenon Perplexity.

Major U.S. indexes ended the week higher, with the Dow up 0.4%, S&P 500 gaining 0.7%, and Nasdaq rising 0.8%, breaking a three-week decline streak. The S&P 500’s strong Christmas Eve performance fueled hopes for a “Santa Rally,” a historical trend showing gains 64 out of 96 years during December’s final week. Markets started recovering from the Fed’s hawkish rate cut signals but faced renewed volatility Friday, tempering Santa Rally expectations. Despite near-term uncertainty, 2024 remains exceptional, with the S&P 500 matching last year’s 24% gain and U.S. stocks outperforming global markets by the widest margin since 1997. Benzinga provides daily reports on the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week’s most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. “AMD And Micron Are Top Analyst Picks For AI And Next-Gen Tech Growth,” by Anusuya Lahiri, highlights Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD being a top 2025 analyst’s pick for CPU/GPU momentum and AI edge opportunities, and Micron Technology, Inc. MU for its dominance in high-bandwidth memory. “Dogecoin Whales Load Up Coins Worth $92 Million Over 4 Days As Meme King Outperforms Bitcoin, Ethereum In 2024,” by Shivdeep Dhaliwal, reports that whale investors acquired 270 million Dogecoin DOGE/USD, worth $92 million, over four days, boosting DOGE's 274% YTD rally, far outpacing Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD gains of 132% and 53%, respectively. “Quantum Computing Stock QUBT Soars 157% While Bitcoin Drops Post Google's ‘Willow’ Reveal,” by Aniket Verma, highlights Quantum Computing Inc. QUBT surging after Google's “Willow” chip breakthrough, outperforming key indices, while Bitcoin faced a downturn amid concerns Willow’s quantum power could undermine cryptographic security.

Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI) is one of those companies. The San Jose, Calif.-based tech firm specializes in high-performance and high-efficiency servers, but it also provides software solutions as well as storage systems for data centers and enterprises focusing on cloud computing, AI, 5G, and edge computing. Nonetheless, analysts expect big upside potential for the tech stock. Hindsight is 20/20, and all that matters now is how Super Micro Computer will perform going forward. So 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide investors — and potential investors — with an idea of where shares of SMCI could be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Super Micro Computer’s future stock performance is being bolstered by explosive demand in the IT services industry. SMCI is shrinking its margins to increase production capacity to meet demand.

Super Micro Computer News and Analysis 12/11/2024 The NASDAQ-100 index is scheduled to undergo its annual reconstitution this Friday. There is a possibility that SMCI might be replaced with MicroStrategy (MSTR) or Palantir (PLTR) during this reconstitution. 12/9/2024 Super Micro Computer has been granted an extension by the Nasdaq stock exchange to submit its delayed annual and quarterly reports. The company now has until February 25, 2025, to file its 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30th and its 10-Q report for the quarter ended September 30th. 12/6/2024 Super Micro Computer’s recent stock price has been up and down since its incredible three-day 49% surge on November 26th. However, despite this volatility, the stock has managed to maintain an overall upward trend. 12/4/2024 Super Micro Computer saw a 1.2% decrease in its shares today, reaching a low of $41.14. 12/3/2024 Super Micro Computer took a hit today. Shares sank 7.1% during midday trading, dipping as low as $39.02. Trading volume also rose 34% above the average daily volume. 11/27/2024 Super Micro Computer has been making waves in the stock market this week due to its extreme volatility. Shares rose dramatically 15.9% on Monday but plummeted 9.7% the next day. Investors are concerned about these wild swings. 11/26/2024 Shares of Super Micro Computer took a big hit today, reversing the recent upward trend. The stock price dropped by 8% in early trading. 11/25/2024 Super Micro Computer’s stock is continuing to rally today, surging 15.9%. The company appears to be recovering from recent downturns as the stock reclaims its 50-day moving average. 11/22/2024 Super Micro Computer’s stock price increased 9.7% today, trading as high as $34.37. 11/21/2024 Shares of companies that partner with Nvidia, which includes Super Micro Computer, increased today following Nvidia’s impressive third-quarter earnings report. Super Micro Computer’s stock price rose 15%. Super Micro Computer’s Recent Stock Success Shares of SMCI have been particularly rewarding to shareholders in the recent past, as they exploded by gaining 3,096% in the five years between August 2019 and August 2024. The following table summarizes Super Micro Computer’s share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2023: Year Share Price (pre-split) Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $36.39 $1.467 $.054 2015 $24.66 $1.954 $.092 2016 $28.05 $2.225 $.072 2017 $20.93 $2.484 $.067 2018 $13.90 $3.360 $.046 2019 $24.65 $3.500 $.072 2020 $31.66 $3.339 $.084 2021 $43.95 $3.557 $.112 2022 $82.19 $5.196 $.285 2023 $284.26 $7.123 $.640 *Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Super Micro Computer’s revenue grew by more than 385% while its net income increased by just over 1,085%. Despite seeing a minor revenue contraction in 2020 with a decrease of 4.6%, shares of SMCI still managed to increase year-over-year on still-growing net income. As the IT services provider looks forward to the second half of the decade, we have identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance. Key Drivers of Super Micro Computer’s Stock Performance Enormous Industry Growth: According to Statista, global revenues generated by the IT services industry are $1.420 trillion. Looking forward, that figure is forecast to balloon to $1.879 trillion worldwide by the end of 2029, which is good for a market increase of 32.32%. Most of this growth will be driven by demand for services and solutions that support AI, but other drivers include digital transformation and cloud IT infrastructure — both of which are major business segments for Super Micro Computer. The company has a global reach, with more than half of its revenue being produced from outside of the U.S., meaning it will play a central role in meeting that global growth demand. Shrinking Margins to Increase AI Production Capacity: Super Micro Computer finished the fiscal year 2024 with a sizable reduction in its margins. And while that would usually be interpreted negatively by investors, it makes perfect sense for the company. In 2024, gross margins shrink to 14.2% from 18.1% in fiscal 2023. The main driver is increasing production of its server solutions to deploy AI graphics processing units (GPUs) — like those produced by tech behemoths NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). As a result, the company is positioning itself for growth alongside increased demand for GPUs, which ultimately will cause NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices’ successes to trickle down to Super Micro Computer. Most recently, 70% of SMCI’s revenue was from sales of its GPU server solutions for AI implementation. The market for direct liquid cooling (DLC) servers — which Super Micro Computer provides — is expected to grow from $5 billion in 2024 to $21 billion in 2029. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Super Micro Computer is $65.00, which represents a nearly 60.34% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $40.54. Of all the analysts covering Super Micro Computer, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 2.38 ‘Outperform’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Super Micro Computer’s stock price to be $68.34 based on a projected EPS of $3.35 in 2025. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $28.265 $1.974 $3.35 2026 $31.634 $2.548 $4.31 2027 $37.116 $1.458 $5.49 2028 $42.631 $1.881 $6.76 2029 $50.154 $2.428 $8.49 2030 $59.005 $3.134 $10.62 *Revenue and net income in $billions How Super Micro Computer’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we expect to see revenue, net income, and EPS rise by 89.16%, 63.41%, and 70.08%, respectively. That would result in a per-share price of $683.40 (or $68.34 on a post-split-adjusted basis), which is 1585.74% higher than where the stock is currently trading. When 2026 concludes, we estimate the price of SMCI to be $798.66 (or $79.87 on a post-split-adjusted basis), which is 1870.05% higher than where shares are trading today. This is based on modest revenue gains, an assumed EPS of $44.37, and a healthy projected P/E ratio of 18. At the conclusion of 2027, we forecast a sizable jump in the stock price to $861.28 (or $86.13 on a post-split-adjusted basis) driven by $37.116 billion in revenue and $1.458 billion in net income, which will result in shares trading for 2024.52% higher than the current share price. By the end of 2028, we expect to see shares trading for $1041.04 (or $101.40 on a post-split-adjusted basis), or 2467.93% higher than the stock is trading for today on revenues of $42.631 billion, net income of $1.881 billion, and an EPS of $67.60. And at the end of 2029, Super Micro Computer is forecast to achieve revenue of $50.154 billion and net income of $2.428 billion, resulting in a per share price of $1188.59 (or $118.86 on a post-split-adjusted basis), which is 2831.89% higher than the stock’s current price. Super Micro Computer’s Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, we estimate an SMCI share price of $1386.08 (or $138.61 on a post-split-adjusted basis), good for a 3319.04% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $106.62 and a P/E ratio of 13. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2025 $68.34 Upside of 1585.74% 2026 $79.87 Upside of 1870.05% 2027 $86.13 Upside of 2024.52% 2028 $101.40 Upside of 2467.93% 2029 $118.86 Upside of 2831.89% 2030 $138.61 Upside of 3319.04% Take This Retirement Quiz To Get Matched With An Advisor Now (Sponsored) Are you ready for retirement?

Let’s look at some of the major indexes in premarket trading. Dow Jones Industrial Futures: Up 373 points (.84%) S&amp;P 500 Futures: Up 42 points (+.71%) Nasdaq Futures: Up 166 points (+.80%) The big storyline on Wall Street is the nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. Bessent is a former hedge fund manager who was favored by Wall Street. He’s pitched a pro-growth agenda that prioritizes boosting GDP growth rates as a means of reducing the Federal deficit. In addition, he’s seen as someone who may push back against Donald Trump’s more egregious tariff policies that could harm economic growth. Bessent will push a ‘3-3-3’ agenda. The goal is to cut budget deficits to 3% of GDP by 2028, reach 3% GDP growth through deregulation and pro-growth policies, and produce an additional 3 million barrels of oil per day. He has spoken recently of a coming economic reordering and the need for the United States to enact significant changes to be part of it. Beyond stocks, debt markets seem pleased with Bessent’s nomination. The yield on 10-year Treasuries retreated back to 4.316% after hitting 4.43% on November 21st. Wall Street Upgrades MicroStrategy’s (Nasdaq: MSTR) stock is up 4.4% premarket after receiving several upgrades before market open. Barclays raised their target on the company to $515 from $275. In addition, Bernstein raised their price target to $600 from $290 on the prediction that the company will own 4% of the world’s Bitcoin over the next decade. Another upgrade came from Canaccord, which raised their price target on Microstrategy to $510 from $300. The researcher believes that MicroStrategy can increase its Bitcoin holdings faster than its share count is being diluted. MicroStrategy bought more Bitcoin this morning and now owns 386,700 Bitcoin, which is worth about $37.7 billion at today’s prices. Its stock is trading for a valuation of about $90 billion premarket.
