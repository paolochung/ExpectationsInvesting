Get Insightful Data on Regions, Market Segments, Customer Landscape, and Top Companies (Charts, Tables, Figures and More) – https://www.meticulousresearch.com/product/rwe-oncology-market-5276 Market Challenges Despite significant growth potential, the overall RWE oncology solutions market faces challenges including data privacy and security concerns straining implementation budgets, particularly in cost-sensitive healthcare sectors. Limited interoperability between healthcare systems is creating integration barriers. Additionally, recent global disruptions have exposed vulnerabilities in data standardization processes, affecting data quality and completeness. Rapidly evolving regulatory compliance requirements across different regions are creating implementation concerns, and high implementation and maintenance costs, especially for comprehensive RWE platforms, are delaying adoption, limiting scalability in key healthcare markets. Segment Insights The global RWE oncology solutions market is segmented by component (Datasets [Disparate Datasets, Integrated Datasets], Consulting Services), application (Drug Development & Approvals, Market Access & Reimbursement/Coverage Decisions, Medical Device Development & Approvals, Post-market Surveillance, Other Applications), end user (Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, and Medical Device Companies, Healthcare Payers, Healthcare Providers, Other End Users), and geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa). Market by Component The Datasets segment is expected to account for the largest share of the overall RWE oncology solutions market in 2025, primarily driven by increasing demand for comprehensive cancer data across the healthcare ecosystem, including disparate datasets (EMR/EHR/clinical data, claims & billing data, pharmacy data, cancer registries) and integrated datasets. Their comprehensive coverage, data reliability, and broad adoption across diverse healthcare applications make them indispensable in pharmaceutical research, regulatory submissions, and healthcare decision-making. However, the Consulting Services segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate through 2035, fueled by the growing need for expertise in RWE study design, regulatory guidance, and data interpretation services.

However, the Healthcare Payers segment is expected to witness the highest growth rate during the forecast period, driven by increasing adoption of value-based care models, the need for cost-effectiveness evidence in coverage decisions, and increasing reliance on RWE for value-based healthcare decisions. Geographic Market Insights In 2025, North America is expected to hold the largest share of the global RWE oncology solutions market, followed by Europe, due to its advanced healthcare infrastructure, strong regulatory support for RWE, well-established pharmaceutical industry, favorable reimbursement policies, and the strong presence of prominent RWE solution providers. Additionally, high cancer incidence rates and mature data analytics capabilities contribute significantly to market dominance. However, the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, India, and South Korea, is projected to experience the fastest growth during the forecast period. This acceleration is mainly driven by rising cancer burden, expanding healthcare infrastructure, growing pharmaceutical investments, increasing awareness about precision medicine approaches, and the region's pivotal role as a global pharmaceutical manufacturing center.

ORCL,2025-05-14 16:13:32,With Trillions Coming Into the United States One Investment Says ‘Buy’,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/with-trillions-coming-into-the-united-states-one-investment-20250514.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"A perfect storm of the greatest financial opportunities of our lifetimes may be before us, with unprecedented amounts of foreign capital, 18 trade deals in the final stages of negotiation, and upcoming tax cuts. Nearly $3 trillion of investment commitments in AI have been announced, which span a period of years. Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple are major players, along with the UAE, Open AI, and Softbank.Risk is present from China producing less expensive or more powerful chips, or imposing trade restrictions that could greatly impact our tech companies. However, the US is striving to be the dominant world leader of AI, for which It does not take a genius to consider long term holds for Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple. In the last 5 weeks NVIDIA has risen 23.6%, up from a low of 94, to 116. However, that is well under their 2025 highpoint of 149. Similarly, the 2025 high of Oracle was 186, but currently is 150, while Apple has dropped 61 points since the day after Christmas, and is now 198, down 23.5%. Although we may see some significant volatility with trade negotiations in the short term, for the coming years, I would expect the large domestic investments made by these key tech companies to produce excellent returns. Also, Taiwan Semiconductors is investing $100 billion for producing their chips here, and that stock is down over 21% in the last 2 ½ months. Likely this would also be a very good hold.What do AI data centers need? Electricity! By 2030, AI data centers are estimated to require 9% of total electricity usage in the United States, with overall demand for electricity projected to increase by 16%. AI data centers are planned for Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, North Carolina, and other areas, for which one might look at providers of electricity in those states. Oncor, that is owned by Sempra, is a major servicer of Texas. The parent company is one of the largest utility holding companies in the US, with current pricing of $75 per share, which is down from $87 in early January, and is paying a dividend of 3.4%. American Electric Power (AEP) is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, for which that stock is up almost 14% this year, and paying a current dividend yield of 3.54%. AEP exceeded analyst expectations of earnings per share by 8.1%, while Ohio is experiencing growth with favorable tax legislation. Several AI data centers are planned for south Florida, while Florida has experienced tremendous population growth, gaining nearly 2 million more residents since 2019. When speaking of electricity to power Florida, one might consider investments in Nexterra, that owns Florida Power and Light, the largest utility in the state, and has a dividend yield of 3.22%. I also am an advocate for Duke Energy, which is held by numerous pension funds. Duke is one of the three great universities of Research Triangle Park, along with the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State. This area of the country has one of the highest concentrations of PhD’s, for which Apple and others are investing in data centers in North Carolina. Duke Energy is up about 12% in 2025, which is excellent for a bit over 4 months, and has a dividend yield of 3.47%.An additional component for not only the construction of AI data centers, but for the expansion of many industries that will benefit from the huge investments being made in the US, is&#8230; infrastructure! This leads one to ETFs for materials. One might take a look at XLB, Vanguard Materials (VAW), and Invesco (PYZ).What is driving both foreign and domestic investment in the US, is the likely legislation of tax cuts, combined with no tariffs for producing goods in the United States. This is a one-two punch for an economic stimulus, along with 18 trade deals being in the stages of final negotiation, which hopefully will dramatically increase US production and exports.This is the first in a series of articles to capitalize on the trillions of dollars of investment commitments that have been announced in recent weeks, along with a multitude of trade deals and tax cut legislation that should be forthcoming. The phrase that comes to mind is that the best time is… NOW!I encourage the reader to do their own research, and to consult with a competent investment advisor.

The standardization of diverse datasets from sources such as clinical trials, electronic health records (EHRs), genomics, and real-world evidence is essential for the efficient exchange of information across various platforms and geographical regions. This standardization enhances multi-site clinical trials and cross-border research collaborations. Additionally, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cognitive computing play a vital role in transforming large volumes of raw data into actionable insights. These technologies help simplify reports and create interactive dashboards. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of analytics in pre-clinical trials, drug discovery, and clinical trials, particularly for applications such as patient recruitment and site identification, helps to reduce the workload for researchers and investigators. These factors contribute significantly to the growing adoption of analytics across the life sciences industry. Download PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=174990653 Browse in-depth TOC on ""Life Science Analytics Market"" 100 - Tables50 - Figures500 - Pages By Based on type, the life science analytics services market is categorized into two main types: managed services and professional services. In 2024, the managed services segment held the largest share of the life science analytics market. This significant share is largely due to the increasing demand for advanced insights, the need for cost-effective drug development, technological advancements in the industry, and the necessity for ongoing support in strategic decision-making. These factors make outsourcing analytics and consulting more attractive for life science companies. Leading companies in the field offer consulting services that leverage data and analytics to evaluate opportunities, design analytics strategies, and implement appropriate technology solutions. For instance, in May 2023, SAS Institute (US) partnered with HTEC (US) to deliver strategic analytics consulting services across various sectors, including life sciences and healthcare. By Based on applications, The life science analytics market is divided into several applications, including research & development, commercial analytics, regulatory compliance, manufacturing and supply chain optimization, and safety. In 2024, the research & development segment held the largest share of this market. This significant share is mainly due to its capacity to accelerate drug discovery, optimize clinical trials, and improve research accuracy through advanced data analysis and AI-driven insights. Additionally, factors such as increasing R&D expenditure in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors, a rise in patent expirations and declining drug pipelines, and a growing focus on personalized medicine and precision therapeutics are further driving growth in this segment. By geography, the life science analytics market is divided into five primary regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa.

ORCL,2025-05-02 10:05:00,"Blockchain As A Service Market is expected to generate a revenue of USD 347.25 Billion by 2031, Globally, at 71.20% CAGR: Verified Market Research®",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/blockchain-as-a-service-market-is-expected-to-generate-20250502.jpg,https://www.prnewswire.com,"Strategically, the Blockchain As A Service (BaaS) market presents strong growth potential, especially in regions like North America with mature digital infrastructure and regulatory support. Market entry should prioritize sectors like finance, supply chain, and healthcare, where blockchain adoption is accelerating. However, high implementation costs and regulatory uncertainty require careful risk assessment and strategic partnerships. Firms should offer scalable, compliant, and cost-efficient BaaS solutions, while investing in customer education and technical support to overcome integration challenges and capitalize on long-term enterprise adoption trends. LEWES, Del., May 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Global Blockchain As A Service Market Size is projected to grow at a CAGR of 71.20% from 2024 to 2031, according to a new report published by Verified Market Research®. The report reveals that the market was valued at USD 47.93 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 347.25 Billion by the end of the forecast period. The Blockchain As A Service Market is evolving rapidly, fueled by adoption in BFSI, healthcare, and supply chain sectors. Enterprises are leveraging BaaS for improved traceability, security, and data integrity. The market shows strong potential amid growing digitization trends. Key Highlights of the Report: Why This Report Matters: This report delivers actionable insights into a rapidly evolving market where blockchain is transforming business models. It empowers decision-makers with data-driven forecasts, competitive intelligence, and technology trends to stay ahead of industry shifts. Who You Should Read This Report: For more information or to purchase the report, please contact us at: https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/download-sample?rid=10565 Browse in-depth TOC on ""Global Blockchain As A Service Market Size"" 202 – Pages126 – Tables37 – Figures Report Scope Global Blockchain As A Service Market Overview Market Driver Surge in Enterprise Demand for Secure Digital Transactions: As cyber risks advance, organizations are transitioning to decentralized architectures to safeguard sensitive data and preserve transaction integrity. Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) provides strong cryptographic security and audit capabilities, minimizing fraud and illegal access. Entities within the BFSI, legal, and healthcare sectors are implementing BaaS to enhance verification procedures, mitigate operational risks, and bolster trust among stakeholders. Increasing Adoption in Supply Chain and Logistics: Blockchain facilitates real-time asset monitoring, provenance verification, and immutable recording—essential requirements for contemporary supply chains. Logistics firms, manufacturers, and retailers are integrating BaaS platforms to assure compliance, mitigate counterfeit concerns, and improve supplier transparency. Due to increasing ESG and traceability demands, companies are investing in BaaS to digitally transform their comprehensive supply networks. Growth of Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps): Smart contracts are transforming enterprise automation by eliminating the necessity for third-party validation in contractual processes. Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) solutions empower enterprises to construct, implement, and oversee smart contracts on scalable blockchain networks without necessitating internal blockchain infrastructure. Industries such as insurance, finance, and energy are adopting BaaS to mitigate delays, enforce contractual commitments, and diminish disputes through self-executing protocols. To Purchase a Comprehensive Report Analysis: https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/select-licence?rid=10565 Market Restraint Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance Challenges: The international blockchain regulatory framework is disjointed and continues to develop. Businesses encounter uncertainty around the alignment of blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and digital identities with local compliance regulations, including GDPR, HIPAA, and financial reporting standards. The intricate regulatory landscape, especially for cross-border operations, obstructs comprehensive BaaS implementations and introduces legal and reputational risks. High Implementation and Integration Costs: While BaaS diminishes the price associated with constructing blockchain infrastructure from the ground up, overall implementation costs might be considerable. Organizations must allocate resources for customisation, user training, legacy system integration, and post-deployment maintenance. For SMEs, the initial and recurring expenses remain high, deterring adoption despite the technology's promise for long-term ROI. Limited Availability of Blockchain Expertise: Blockchain continues to be a specialized competency inside the global labor market. Many firms lack the internal technical expertise necessary to efficiently implement, scale, and secure BaaS infrastructures. The learning curve related to distributed ledger technologies, consensus processes, and smart contract programming hinders implementation deadlines. This skills deficit increases dependence on external consultants and impedes innovation cycles. Geographical Dominance North America possesses the predominant stake in the Blockchain As A Service (BaaS) industry, propelled by early adoption in financial services, healthcare, and logistics. The existence of influential major actors, along with robust regulatory support for digital transformation, drives regional growth. U.S. companies are utilizing BaaS to improve data security, optimize operations, and maintain competitiveness, establishing the area as a global center for blockchain innovation.

Trump’s 2024 electoral campaign was buoyed by the hope that his leadership would return the economic prosperity of his previous term, which had been decimated by Bidenomics and rampant Congressional spending, fueling inflation to the worst levels in 40 years. Central to President Trump’s strong economic performance from 2016-2020 was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. TCHA resulted in unprecedented business growth, new entrepreneurism, historically low unemployment among all ethnic groups, and consumer confidence soaring to an 18-year high. The 21% corporate rate is one of the few permanent aspects to TCJA not subject to expiration. President Trump has been adamant about the need to renew TCJA, as other key provisions expire in December, 2025. He is also proposing additional tax cuts, such as taxes on overtime, tips, Social Security payments, and has even proposed eliminating federal income tax altogether, to be replaced with revenues from a national consumption tax and tariffs. However, analysts have debated the merits of further tax cuts, the impact on the national debt, and whether or not Congress would ultimately be able to legislate these proposals into law. Key Points The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) delivered unprecedented business growth and entrepreneurism, in addition to additional retained money in the pockets of a majority of American citizens. President Trump campaigned on cutting taxes further on a number of fronts, including renewal of TCJA before its expiration in December, 2025. Many analysts who have debated over the effectiveness of further tax cuts fail to include the massive regulatory cuts, the large pending reductions in wasteful spending being identified by DOGE, and the resultant job creation, business growth, and fresh investment into US business as a result of the tariff policies.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Arguments Against Tax Cuts and The Truth Senator Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is one of the main opponents to tax cuts and reduced spending that take away power from Democrats&#8217; pet projects. Not surprisingly, the entirety of elected Democrats, as well as left-leaning Republicans, have been the loudest voices against cutting taxes. Democrat leaders like Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have been among the more articulate critics, although their mantras about “tax cuts would only be for the top 1%” and that “the rich don’t pay their fair share” have been thoroughly debunked by genuine statistics and even left leaning Factcheck.org. In actuality, TCJA benefited over 75% of all US taxpayers, and it has been verified that the top 1%, in fact, pay 40% of the entirety of federal income tax. The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis projects that a TCJA extension would create increased deficits based on reduced tax revenues from present levels. It forecasts a $4.6 trillion shortfall over 10 years, accounting for interest on outstanding federal debt. The Tax Policy Center projected that economic growth would offset only 6% of the shortfall. One crucial point is that neither the CBO or TPC prognostications take into account any significant spending cuts nor how tariffs will accelerate cutting deficits, as well as other key policy ramifications already in effect in the Trump Administration: How tariffs are creating fresh US investment, new businesses, and more crucial private sector jobs. The impact of lower tax rates and the elimination of onerous Biden-imposed regulatory burdens are jump-starting new manufacturing and other major business creation. How ending potential trillions in fraudulent, misappropriated, and likely criminal spending waste from USAID and numerous other federal agencies uncovered by DOGE will accelerate the goal towards eliminating the trillions in federal debt overhang via drastically reduced spending. Why a national consumption tax effectively rebuts Democrat opponents’ claims of “unfairness” and “only favoring the rich”. Trump Fiscal Policy Results In The First 60+ Days Cutting the trillions of wasteful and criminal spending of taxpayer dollars uncovered by Elon Musk and DOGE could accelerate President Trump&#8217;s plans to fix the US economy and restore manufacturing and other critical businesses. Since taking office in January, the threat of Trump&#8217;s tariffs has already created a seismic shift in the corporate business environment. For example: In response to prospective 25% tariffs on products made in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor, the maker of all of the GPUs from Nvidia and AMD required to run Artificial Intelligence, announced a $100 billion investment into new factories to be located in AZ for making GPUs and other semiconductor products expressly for the US market. SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan pledged to invest $50 billion in the US to create 50,000 new jobs. Apple announced it invested $500 billion for AI servers to be built in Michigan and Texas, creating 20,000 new jobs. Oracle, ChatGPT, and OpenAI announced its Stargate JV would invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure construction, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in various states, commencing with Texas. The revival of US-manufactured steel and copper is already underway, thanks to US tariffs to prevent dumping from China and other nations into the US market. Additionally, Elon Musk’s DOGE has been uncovering misappropriated taxpayer funds, payments to nonexistent recipients, and useless pork projects ostensibly designed to serve as political kickbacks and bribes to overseas entities, all of which are in the process of being cut. The anticipated spending cuts, something not factored into the CBO calculations, could drastically accelerate the rate of reducing the federal debt. A recent CBS poll found that 77% of the American public supports the work of DOGE. Lastly, a consumption tax, proposed as a 14-17% tax on all new goods except for food and medicine, would be a tax that visibly and unequivocally hits the wealthiest the hardest, thus debunking any accusations about unfairness. With no loopholes, a flat consumption tax is based on the value of the purchased item. Since expensive goods that are only affordable for the wealthy have a higher price tag, the commensurate tax revenues from those items will generate more tax revenues. President Trump was given a mandate by the electorate. While he has already enacted some of his plans to good effect, his tax and regulatory cutting proposals will still require much combating with Democrats, the predominant recipients of high taxes and big government spending. Over the next 4 years, the results of these battles will determine the extent of the initiatives’ full financial benefits.

Chinese rival BYD just introduced its advanced driver-assistance features across most of its EVs for no extra cost, fueling a brutal price war. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) Chinese Rival BYD Now Has a Competitive Advantage Chinese rival BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) just introduced its advanced driver-assistance features across most of its EVs for no extra cost – along with the integration of DeepSeek software. According to Bloomberg, “BYD said it will make its God’s Eye driver-assistance system standard in vehicles priced from 100,000 yuan ($13,700) and include it in several lower-cost models such as the popular Seagull hatchback.” All of which gives BYD a significant advantage over other EV companies, like Tesla. Granted, Tesla also released similar full self-driving features in the U.S., but it’s charging a subscription fee of $99 a month, or a one-time payment of $8,000. Tesla is also waiting on regulatory approval to launch trials in the Chinese market. Meanwhile, “BYD has now gone from 0 to 1 in assisted driving development, which will accelerate the adoption rate of Navigation on Autopilot function in the mass market and lead to a wave of upgrades by existing users,” Jefferies’ analysts added, as also quoted by Bloomberg. All of which is sure to fuel a brutal, ongoing price war in the electric vehicle market. There are also concerns over Elon Musk’s other distractions Investors are nervous about Elon Musk’s many distractions, too. Not only is he busy in D.C., he’s trying to gain control of OpenAI from Sam Altman, leading a group of investors who offered to buy it for $97.4 billion. However, Altman rejected the offer, noting that “Our structure exists to ensure that no individual can take control of OpenAI,” as quoted by Wired.com. “Elon runs a competitive AI company, and his actions are not about OpenAI’s mission or values.” Musk also runs SpaceX, xAI, and other firms. He has a position in President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. He needs to challenge BYD with lower-priced electric vehicles. And there are also concerns Elon Musk may have to sell some of his Tesla shares to fund his ventures. In short, there are plenty of reasons shares of Tesla could pull back even more. BYD just introduced its advanced driver-assistance features across most of its EVs for no extra cost – along with the integration of DeepSeek software – which is sure to fuel a brutal, ongoing price war. Plus, investors are greatly concerned Elon Musk has too many distractions. After dropping from about $475 to its current price of $328.50, Tesla could pull back even more if Musk fails to right the ship. From $328.50, Tesla’s next support line is at $309.22. Worst case, Tesla could plummet back to its November low of $238.88. Let’s just hope it doesn’t get that bad.

ORCL,2024-12-27 04:30:39,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241227.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tens of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 12/20/2024 Morgan Stanley analysts have lowered their price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $169 to $158, while maintaining an “equal weight” rating on the stock. Despite this lowered target, it still suggest a potential upside of 30.75% from AMD’s current price. 12/18/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock has reached a 52-week low of $121.82, valuing the company at $199 billion. This decline, coupled with a beta of 1.64, indicates significant price volatility as investors grapple with economic uncertainties and shifting market dynamics. 12/16/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock price dipped 1.3% in midday trading today, reaching a low of $123.12. Trading volume was also much lower than average, with only 15.7 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock experienced a slight decline of 0.2% during today’s midday trading, fluctuating between $129.13 and $129.92. Trading volume was also much lower than average. 12/11/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ CEO Lisa Su has been named Time Magazine’s CEO of the year. Since taking over in 2014, Su has orchestrated an incredible turnaround for the company, driving AMD’s stock price up by a staggering 3700%. 12/9/2024 Vivek Arya, an analyst with Bank of America, downgraded Advanced Micro Devices stock from “Buy” to “Neutral” and lowered its price target from $180 to $155. This downgrade follows Amazon’s executives reports of weak demand for AMD’s AI accelerators and led to a decline in AMD’s stock today. 12/6/2024 AMD’s stock price has gone down today. This decrease followed an Amazon executive’s report that the company hasn’t observed enough demand for AMD’s AI accelerators to warrant their sale through Amazon Web Services. 12/5/2024 Mizuho has lowered its price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $185 to $180, but still maintains a “Buy” rating on the stock. This revised target price suggests a potential upside of 26.64% from AMD’s current market price. 12/3/2024 Advanced Micro Devices stock declined 0.3% today, trading between $141.23 and $141.61. 11/27/2024 Advanced Micro Devices has solidified its commitment to Indian by inaugurating a new research and development center. This move aligns with the company’s previously announced $400 million investment in the country. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD’s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024. Fiscal Year (Dec) Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $2.87 $3.991 B -($660 M) 2016 $11.34 $4.319 B -($498 M) 2017 $10.28 $5.253 B -($33 M) 2018 $18.46 $6.475 B $337 M 2019 $45.86 $6.731 B $341 M 2020 $91.71 $9.763 B $2.490 B 2021 $143.90 $16.434 B $3.162 B 2022 $64.77 $23.601 B $1.320 B 2023 $147.41 $22.680 B $864 M 2024 LTM (Jun 2024) $$162.21 $23.276 B $$1.354 B Key Drivers for AMD’s Stock in the Future Lisa Su’s release of AMD’s MI300 GPU has thrown down the gauntlet for AI to her cousin, CEO Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which controls close to 70% of the AI GPU market at present. AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 47.99% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 62.48% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.

ORCL,2024-12-11 03:58:48,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-price-prediction-and-forecast-20252030-20241211.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tents of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 12/9/2024 Vivek Arya, an analyst with Bank of America, downgraded Advanced Micro Devices stock from “Buy” to “Neutral” and lowered its price target from $180 to $155. This downgrade follows Amazon’s executives reports of weak demand for AMD’s AI accelerators and led to a decline in AMD’s stock today. 12/6/2024 AMD’s stock price has gone down today. This decrease followed an Amazon executive’s report that the company hasn’t observed enough demand for AMD’s AI accelerators to warrant their sale through Amazon Web Services. 12/5/2024 Mizuho has lowered its price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $185 to $180, but still maintains a “Buy” rating on the stock. This revised target price suggests a potential upside of 26.64% from AMD’s current market price. 12/3/2024 Advanced Micro Devices stock declined 0.3% today, trading between $141.23 and $141.61. 11/27/2024 Advanced Micro Devices has solidified its commitment to Indian by inaugurating a new research and development center. This move aligns with the company’s previously announced $400 million investment in the country. 11/26/2024 Advanced Micro Devices is planning to acquire ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in a strategic move to bolster its position in the AI market and challenge Nvidia’s dominance. ZT Systems will bring expertise to AMD and encourage accelerated deployment of AI infrastructure at scale. 11/25/2024 Advanced Micro Devices is investing $400 million in India, highlighting the importance of its Bengaluru R&amp;D center to its global operations and India as a key market and vital hub for technological innovation and growth. 11/22/2024 Analysts at Zacks Research have increased their earnings estimates for Advanced Micro Devices from $2.37 to $2.47. Zacks Research also provided estimates for AMD’s earnings in the upcoming quarters and fiscal years. These estimates range from $0.81 per share in Q4 2024 to $4.63 per share in FY 2026. 11/21/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ shares decreased 1.4% today, trading as low as $134.93. 11/20/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock declined slightly by 1.1% today, trading as low as $137.06. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD’s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024. Fiscal Year (Dec) Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $2.87 $3.991 B -($660 M) 2016 $11.34 $4.319 B -($498 M) 2017 $10.28 $5.253 B -($33 M) 2018 $18.46 $6.475 B $337 M 2019 $45.86 $6.731 B $341 M 2020 $91.71 $9.763 B $2.490 B 2021 $143.90 $16.434 B $3.162 B 2022 $64.77 $23.601 B $1.320 B 2023 $147.41 $22.680 B $864 M 2024 LTM (Jun 2024) $$162.21 $23.276 B $$1.354 B Key Drivers for AMD’s Stock in the Future Lisa Su’s release of AMD’s MI300 GPU has thrown down the gauntlet for AI to her cousin, CEO Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which controls close to 70% of the AI GPU market at present. AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 42.53% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 48.31% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.

This follows the strategic investor, a subsidiary of A$4 billion major Chinese miner Inner Mongolia Xingye Silver & Tin Mining Co., Ltd, receiving all necessary Chinese regulatory approvals to release the A$3,498,638.40 Tranche 2 funds. Following the receipt of the first tranche of A$6.4 million early last month, Xingye has taken its investment in Far East Gold to almost A$9.9 million with a further amount of approximately $3.85 million expected in the third tranche. Far East Gold shares are 8.82% higher on the ASX to A$0.185. READ: Far East Gold receives first A$6.4 million tranche of investment by Xingye At the time of the conditional share placement agreement with Xingye in early September 2024, the investment was valued at approximately A$14 million which would give it a stake in Far East Gold of 19.9%. All tranches were priced at A$0.20 per share, which at the time represented a 47% premium to the company’s recent placement and share purchase plan and a 21% premium to the company’s last traded price. On November 28, Far East Gold advised that it had received approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) for the second and third tranches. Shareholder approval for the third tranche was granted the following day at FEG’s AGM as it exceeded the company’s existing placement capacity (Listing Rule 7.1 and Listing Rule 7.1A). READ: Far East Gold attracts major Chinese miner Xingye as strategic partner with A$14 million investment This investment is a major shot in the arm for Far East Gold as Shenzhen-listed Xingye, which has a market capitalisation of more than A$4 billion is the largest silver producer in China, one of the largest silver producers in the world and China’s second largest tin producer. Along with the significant investment, FEG, which is primarily focused on gold and copper in Indonesia, is expected to benefit from Xingye’s deep technical expertise in bringing greenfield projects through to production. Far East Gold CEO Shane Menere said: ""Partnering with one of China’s most successful precious metals producers validates the potential of FEG’s portfolio of world-class assets and gives the company a clear pathway through to project development in 2025.” Xingye’s main business is non-ferrous metal mining and smelting, operating a full mining industry chain from geological exploration, mining, mineral processing to smelting of silver and tin. In addition, it has also been actively exploring for copper and gold in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Indonesia and Africa for the past five years. The company, which has 13 subsidiaries and 1 partnership enterprise, has diverse mineral resources and rich reserves with the main products being silver, tin, lead, zinc, copper, iron, bismuth, tungsten, antimony, gold and other non-ferrous metals, precious metals and ferrous metals. With completion of tranche 2, Xingye is also entitled to nominate one director for appointment to Far East Gold’s Board of Directors. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL, ETR:ORC) stock plunged afterhours as the software firm’s fiscal second quarter earnings missed Wall Street forecasts. Earnings per share of $1.47 were short of the consensus of $1.48. Revenue rose 9% year-over-year to $14.1 billion, short of the consensus of $14.12 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues increased 12% from the year-ago quarter to $10.8 billion while Cloud license and on-premise licence revenues were $1.2 billion. Oracle CEO Safra Catz noted “extraordinary” growth in the AI segment of its infrastructure business during the quarter. “Growth in the AI segment of our Infrastructure business was extraordinary—GPU consumption was up 336% in the quarter—and we delivered the world's largest and fastest AI SuperComputer scaling up to 65,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs,” Catz said. “With our remaining performance obligation (RPO) up 50% to $97 billion, we believe our already impressive growth rates will continue to climb even higher.” Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison highlighted that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains generative AI models. “The Oracle Cloud trains dozens of specialized AI models and embeds hundreds of AI Agents in cloud applications,” he said. “For example, Oracle's AI Agents automate drug design, image and genomic analysis for cancer diagnostics, audio updates to electronic health records for patient care, satellite image analysis to predict and improve agricultural output, fraud and money laundering detection, dual-factor biometric computer logins, and real-time video weapons detection in schools.” Shares of Oracle traded down 6.4% post-earnings.",https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1062460/far-east-gold-receives-a-3-5-million-in-second-tranche-of-xingye-investment-1062460.html

Meanwhile, global advertising stocks rallied as Omnicom and Interpublic neared a long-awaited union that would reshape the industry . Interpublic surged premarket, and shares in European rivals Publicis and WPP rose. South Korean markets came under renewed pressure after the leader of the country's ruling party said embattled president Yoon Suk Yeol would no longer be involved in running the country , in a move aimed at stabilizing state affairs. Investors were also assessing developments in the Middle East, where the Assad family dictatorship collapsed over the weekend. Rebel forces claimed control of Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia. Also this week, central banks in Europe and Canada will meet to decide on interest rates. Premarket Movers Apollo Global Management and Workday, will be added to the S&P 500 in the index's quarterly rebalancing, replacing Qorvo and Amentum Holdings, both of which will move to the S&P Small Cap 600 index. Apollo Global was up 6.1% and Workday rose 10%. Qorvo and Amentum fell. AppLovin fell 5.4% after it wasn't added to the S&P 500. Barron's had reported Friday that AppLovin, Apollo, and Coinbase Global were leading candidates that might be added to the index because they have three of the largest market values of any companies not in the S&P 500. Coinbase declined 1.8%. Super Micro Computer said it has been granted an extension from Nasdaq that gives the server marker until Feb. 25, 2025, to file its latest annual report and that it expects to file by the deadline. Shares rose 9.2% Tesla was up 2.1%. Watch For: Oracle 2Q earnings Today's Headlines/Must Reads: - Tapped-Out Private-Equity Investors Decline New Commitments - New York City's Biggest Office Landlord Offers a Glimpse of the Market's Comeback - Why Tariffs Could Really Pinch Retailers This Time MARKET WRAPS Forex: The dollar edged lower as investors bet on the Fed cutting interest rates further this month, Swissquote Bank said. Friday's nonfarm payrolls data boosted market expectations for the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at the December 18 meeting, supporting the case for a softer dollar even as investors seek safe haven assets amid global political turmoil. The euro could fall to $1.0500 in the short-term or even lower after the U.S. inflation data and the ECB policy decision later this week, according to ING. Core inflation might have accelerated in November, bringing into question if the Fed would be right to be cutting interest rates and the ECB is likely to cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday which might open the door to taking rates below the so-called neutral rate that neither spurs nor slows growth, ING said. Sterling rose after China's pledge for more proactive fiscal stimulus Monex Europe said. The announcement was supporting risk appetite and offering tailwinds to sterling, it said. Energy: Oil rose on greater uncertainty in the Middle East after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime fell. ""The geopolitical situation in the Middle East is likely to remain tense in the coming days following the collapse of Syria's government,"" ANZ Research said. Still, gains are capped by persistent concerns over global demand and an impending glut despite OPEC+'s decision to extend a series of production cuts. The weak demand outlook was also underscored by Saudi Arabia's decision to lower its January prices for crude grades it sells to Asia, its main market. Focus this week will be on China's Central Economic Work Conference, as well as monthly reports from OPEC, the IEA and the EIA. DNB Markets said Saudi Arabia's decision to cut official oil selling prices for Asia underscores weaker demand in the continent. Aramco will sell January loadings of its flagship Arab Light grade to Asian buyers at a premium of $0.90 a barrel to the regional Dubai/Oman benchmark, compared with $1.70 in December. ""This is the lowest premium to Dubai since the start of 2021, and at the same time as OPEC has extended its production cuts."" Metals: Gold futures rose on geopolitical risk and central bank purchases. The precious metal has gained on safe-haven demand after the Syrian rebels seized Damascus. Israel seized the demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria over the weekend. A softer dollar has further enhanced gold's appeal as a safe-haven. China's central bank also resumed purchases of bullions in November after a six-month pause, which should shore up Chinese investor demand. Gold Chart Comex gold futures' bullish setup is still valid, based on the daily chart, RHB Retail Research said. Friday's price movements have reaffirmed that bears are respecting the immediate support pegged at $2,640. TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES Meet the Small AI Chip Maker Now More Valuable Than Intel Matt Murphy has no interest in running a chip company 10 times the size of his current one. It is the smarter move, and actually the more ambitious one. Murphy, who has served as chief executive officer of Marvell Technology since 2016, has been among the few names floated as potential replacements for the recently ousted Pat Gelsinger at Intel's corner office. That led to the rare sight of a CEO using his own earnings call to deny that he is on the market. Apple Tops the List of Best-Managed Companies of 2024 Technology companies continue to hold most of the top spots in the annual Management Top 250 ranking of America's best-run companies, with Apple unseating Microsoft at No. 1. Rounding out the top four are Nvidia, Microsoft-which came in at No. 1 the previous four years-and Intel. BP, Japan's JERA to Invest Up to $5.8 Billion to Create Offshore Wind JV British energy giant BP and Japanese power-generation company JERA will invest $5.8 billion to create a global offshore wind-energy joint venture. The companies said Monday that the standalone company will have 13 gigawatt of potential net generating capacity. China Adopts Crisis-Era Language as Leaders Signal More Forceful Stimulus BEIJING-China's leaders signaled a more forceful policy approach to shoring up the economy as Beijing braces for trade tensions under the incoming Trump administration, employing language they haven't used since the depths of the global financial crisis. The 24-man Politburo, China's top decision-making body, pledged Monday to implement more proactive fiscal policy and to adopt a ""moderately loose"" monetary policy next year-the first introduction of such language since 2008. Why Tariffs Could Really Pinch Retailers This Time Many retailers came through relatively unscathed by Donald Trump's tariffs imposed starting in 2018. This time around, though, tariffs have the potential to bite more. Trump has proposed a universal tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports to the U.S. and a 60% or more tariff on goods from China. Somewhat confusingly, Trump has also separately threatened 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on China over immigration and drug issues. Trump Says He Has No Plan to Remove Powell at Fed President-elect Donald Trump said he had no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Trump fielded a question about whether he planned to replace Powell, who has said he would not leave the job even if asked to do so. ""No, I don't think so. I don't see it,"" Trump answered. U.S. Scrambles to Shape Post-Assad Syria but Has to Overcome Years of Disengagement WASHINGTON-The unexpectedly rapid downfall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria has turned the country's future from a back-burner issue to a suddenly high-stakes concern for the departing Biden administration-and almost certainly for Donald Trump. U.S. officials are scrambling to assess the intentions of the rebel groups that drove Assad into exile, especially Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is expected to play a pivotal role in whatever government emerges in Damascus but which is on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. Israeli Airstrikes Target Syrian Chemical-Weapons Systems TEL AVIV-Israel said it had struck chemical-weapons caches and other missile and air-defense systems in Syria on Monday, taking advantage of the chaos there to destroy what it sees as dangerous assets that could fall into rebel hands. Since the stunning assault by Syrian rebels that brought down the regime of President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, Israel said it has taken immediate steps to ensure the protection of its border amid the uncertainty engulfing the country. This includes striking targets across Syria and swiftly seizing a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria as well as adjacent points. Inside Ukraine's Battle for the Skies as Russian Bombardments Hit Records POLTAVA, Ukraine-A team of soldiers sat inside a nondescript red bus with their eyes glued to a bank of screens blinking with yellow dots. The shapes represented Russian drones, missiles and planes cutting into Ukrainian skies. Soldiers from Ukraine's 164th Radiotechnical Brigade were trying to quickly identify targets and intercept them before they could sow destruction in towns and cities.

(AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241119.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tens of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 11/18/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’s stock price is on the rise today following the announcement of a partnership with IBM. The two tech giants are teaming up to deploy AMD’s next-generation MI300X accelerators on IBM Cloud. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD’s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024. Fiscal Year (Dec) Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $2.87 $3.991 B -($660 M) 2016 $11.34 $4.319 B -($498 M) 2017 $10.28 $5.253 B -($33 M) 2018 $18.46 $6.475 B $337 M 2019 $45.86 $6.731 B $341 M 2020 $91.71 $9.763 B $2.490 B 2021 $143.90 $16.434 B $3.162 B 2022 $64.77 $23.601 B $1.320 B 2023 $147.41 $22.680 B $864 M 2024 LTM (Jun 2024) $$162.21 $23.276 B $$1.354 B Key Drivers for AMD’s Stock in the Future Lisa Su’s release of AMD’s MI300 GPU has thrown down the gauntlet for AI to her cousin, CEO Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which controls close to 70% of the AI GPU market at present. AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12-months is $186.91, which is 37.75% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 51.23% increase. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 39.74% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20.

Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market but simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD’s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024.

AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 34.00% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 47.12% increase. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 39.74% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.
