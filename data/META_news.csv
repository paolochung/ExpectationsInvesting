However, the software company&#8217;s better-than-expected first-quarter report gave the stock a boost last month. The share price is now 27.9% higher than at the beginning of the year. Compared to a year ago, the stock is 395.0% higher, far outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq in that time. Since the company went public in 2021, its stock price is up 613.9%. So, this has clearly been a top growth stock that investors have done well owning in recent years. AppLovin has been among the top tech stocks seeing a lot of love from the market, but is that still true with the recent overhang? 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) has seen incredibly strong growth, driven by its core business model that helps online advertisers boost monetization and marketing efforts for their solutions. Key drivers propelling AppLovin going forward include its enhancements in AI-powered advertising and its expansion into e-commerce advertising. Here’s where this stock has come since its inception, and where AppLovin could be headed over the next few years. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. These days, the company focuses on providing software solutions that enhance the marketing and monetization of online advertisers. With AppLovin, there are certainly catalysts worth considering, and we&#8217;ll get to those shortly. It continues to benefit from the strong secular growth trends investors are seeking increased exposure to. As investors continue to pile into such stocks, retail investors appear eager to gain outsized exposure ahead of a continued boom. It is worth remembering that AppLovin did experience a drawdown of more than 90% from its post-pandemic highs in 2021. So, is this stock headed for a further beatdown, or is its momentum real? Let&#8217;s dive into some catalysts and price predictions around where this stock could go for the rest of 2025 through to the end of this decade. Three Key Drivers for AppLovin As mentioned, AppLovin investors have to contend with plenty of news. For instance, the analysts covering AppLovin have not been as bullish on this company as many may think, having issued warnings on the stock in the past year or so due to concerns around the company&#8217;s fundamentals. Nonetheless, we see these key drivers propelling AppLovin going forward. 1. AI-Powered Advertising Enhancements AppLovin’s Axon AI engine has been a game-changer, optimizing ad targeting and expanding beyond gaming into new categories like e-commerce, fintech, and automotive advertising. During the Q4 2024 earnings call, CEO Adam Foroughi highlighted that for the first time, AppLovin captured a significant share of holiday shopping ad spend—validating that its AI models are effective outside gaming. Scaling AI Beyond Gaming: The company initially focused on direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands, but early pilots have shown AI-driven success across multiple verticals. This means any business in any industry could potentially tap into AppLovin’s advertising platform. Personalized Advertising With Generative AI: The company is developing automated tools and AI-generated ad creatives to improve engagement. AppLovin’s self-service platform (currently in development) will eventually allow businesses to run ads autonomously with AI-optimized targeting—a major step toward scaling its reach. AppLovin&#8217;s AI capabilities are proving to be industry-agnostic, opening the door for millions of global advertisers. 2. Expansion Into E-Commerce Advertising Foroughi described fourth-quarter 2024 as a major milestone, marking AppLovin’s first real penetration into e-commerce advertising. Historically, the company primarily monetized mobile gaming ads, but now retail and consumer brands are joining the platform in large numbers. Surging Demand From E-Commerce Brands: Advertisers saw strong return on investment during the holiday season, prompting continued demand for the platform in 2025. Pilot Program Scaling Up: While AppLovin hasn’t disclosed the number of e-commerce advertisers, industry checks suggest a significant influx of brands wanting access. Self-Service Expansion Is the Next Big Growth Driver: Currently, the company manually onboards advertisers, but in 2025, the launch of automated tools and a self-serve platform will allow thousands of new businesses to join. E-commerce advertising is set to be a major revenue contributor. Once self-serve tools become operational, adoption could scale exponentially. 3. Strategic Divestment of Mobile Gaming Unit AppLovin is officially exiting game development—a move that frees up resources to focus entirely on advertising technology. $900 Million Sale of Apps Business: AppLovin announced that it has signed an exclusive term sheet to sell its mobile gaming division, with $500 million in cash and $400 million in equity in a private company. Why This Matters: The company originally acquired gaming studios to train its AI models, but it was never meant to be a core business. Now that AI is self-sufficient, AppLovin no longer needs to develop its own games. Shifting to a Pure Ad-Tech Model: With gaming divested, the company can fully concentrate on expanding its advertising ecosystem—positioning itself as a direct competitor to Google and Meta in the ad tech space. Divesting from mobile games is a giant pivot for the stock, as it paves the way as a pure advertising technology company. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 There are clearly strong reasons why AppLovin was up as much as it is this year. Simply put, investors have been banking on AppLovin as a potential AI beneficiary, as several AI advancements have fueled customer success and accelerated the company&#8217;s adoption and growth rates across the board. If the company can continue to prioritize generating outsized free cash flow and return capital to shareholders to a greater degree, I certainly think this multiple could be warranted. Here&#8217;s where the stock could be headed, assuming the company&#8217;s multiple stays the same and earnings grow according to analyst estimates. Wall Street&#8217;s consensus one-year price target for AppLovin has risen to $457.67, which would be a 10.5% gain from the current price. On average, 27 analysts covering AppLovin recommend buying shares, four of them with a Strong Buy rating. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s forecast projects AppLovin&#8217;s stock price to be just $377.10 by year&#8217;s end, or about 9% lower than today&#8217;s price. Yet, we see the stock continuing its strong growth rate and outperforming analysts&#8217; expectations going forward. AppLovin Price Target for 2030 By the end of the decade, we estimate AppLovin’s stock price to be $662.40 per share with less than 10% year-over-year revenue growth. Our estimated stock price will be nearly 60% higher than the current stock price. Year Price Target Upside Potential 2025 $377.10 −8.9% 2026 $445.78 7.6% 2027 $500.47 20.8% 2028 $572.02 38.1% 2029 $609.44 47.2% 2030 $662.40 59.9% Palantir Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 The post AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 (May 30) appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/forecasts/2025/06/06/applovin-price-prediction-and-forecast-2025-2030/

Sour Apple 2:05 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street analyst firm is taking aim at Big Tech stock Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL). Needham analysts believe AAPL shares are too frothy, downgrading shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; The analyst firm also withdrew its price target of $225 per share, saying that the $170-$180 range reflects a more reasonable entry point. AAPL shares are relatively flat today. The Nasdaq Composite is holding onto a gain of 0.43%. Citi Downgrades This Nuclear Stock 11:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Citi has downgraded shares of Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG) on the heels of the utility&#8217;s long-term power arrangement with Big Tech company Meta (Nasdaq: META). Citi analysts attached a high-risk label to CEG stock, saying that it will miss out on premium pricing for its nuclear power, with a price target of $318. After yesterday&#8217;s rally, CEG shares are falling 2.8% today. The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.25% as of mid-morning trading. Wall Street Improves Market Outlook 9:51 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 nearly in the rearview mirror, Wall Street analysts are coming out in droves to revise their year-end forecasts. Most recently, Barclays has updated its S&amp;P 500 year-end outlook by close to 3% to 6,050 compared with a previous target of below 6,000. In addition to Barclays, other analysts firms that have lifted their 2025 S&amp;P 500 targets of late include Deutsche Bank and RBC. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets appear to be shrugging off some lackluster labor market data, with all three of the major stock market averages higher as of early morning trading. Yesterday, the markets managed to turn things around, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tacking on its fourth-straight winning session while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 also gained ground. Today, most sectors of the economy are higher, led by technology with a 1.48% advance. Nvidia&#8217;s (Nasdaq: NVDA) muscled Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) out of the way to reclaim the top of the most valuable company in the world rankings, with a market capitalization of $3.45 trillion. Traders are debating whether NVDA stock will see new highs in the near future. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 62.83 (+0.22%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 50.28 (+0.26%) S&amp;P 500: Up 14.10 (+0.24%) Economic Headwinds Private sector hiring lost momentum in May, with payrolls expanding by a mere 37,000 jobs. Results fell short of April&#8217;s 60,000 gain and also missed the Dow Jones forecast of 110,000 by a wide margin. In a sobering sign for the labor market, it marked the lowest monthly job creation from the ADP report in over two years. Meanwhile, the picture for wages remained largely static compared with the prior month&#8217;s results. President Trump is increasing pressure on Jerome Powell to lower interest rates following the weaker-than-expected private sector jobs data, saying the Fed chairman should have already taken this action. Market Movers Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is racing ahead by 15.8% today, extending yesterday&#8217;s gains on a positive full-year outlook. Fellow discount retailer Dollar Tree (NYSE: DLTR) is gaining 6% on the day on similarly upbeat guidance. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is gaining 2.7% today, recouping some recently lost ground.

Citi Takes Aim at CEG 11:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analyst firm Citi has reduced its rating on Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG) shares in response to the utility&#8217;s long-term power agreement with Mag 7 stock Meta (Nasdaq: META). Analysts at Citi now classify CEG stock as high-risk, arguing that the company will forgo the opportunity for premium pricing on its nuclear-generated electricity.

S&amp;P Outlook Looking Up 10:05 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 almost behind us, Wall Street analysts are actively revising their year-end market forecasts. Most recently, Barclays has adjusted its S&amp;P 500 year-end outlook upward by nearly 3% to 6,050, a notable increase from its previous target of 5,900.

Meta will buy the power generation of a Constellation nuclear plant in Clinton, Ill., to power its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions. The financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Starting in June 2027, ""the agreement supports the relicensing and continued operations of Constellation’s high-performing Clinton nuclear facility for another two decades after the state’s ratepayer funded zero emission credit (ZEC) program expires,"" Constellation said. ""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,"" Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said of the deal. Tuesday’s deal between Constellation and Meta is giving nuclear stocks a fresh lift as the Instagram and Facebook owner joins tech rivals from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google to Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services in pouring millions of dollars to boost their nuclear power access for AI. This deal builds on earlier efforts by Constellation, which said last year it would be restarting Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide electricity for Microsoft’s data centers in a 20-year supply deal. More recently, executive orders signed by President Donald Trump last month to accelerate the approval of new reactors and strengthen fuel supply chains have also buoyed nuclear power stocks.

Led by analyst Binky Chadha, who notably held an ambitious 7,000 target for the broader market index earlier in 2025, the firm has now elevated its year-end S&amp;P 500 projection to 6,550 from a previous 6,150 estimate. This upward revision is viewed as a positive indicator for both overall market trajectory and the prospects of trade deals, suggesting an upside potential of 10% for the S&amp;P 500 from current levels. The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.44%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain uncertain as trade-related setbacks continue to loom. After eking out a slight gain on Monday, the markets are showing little direction today as investors await further trade deal progress. Reflecting caution, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) lowered its growth outlook for the U.S. economy to 1.6% and 1.5% for 2025 and 2026, respectively. Technology stocks are barely higher as a sector, delivering a nearly flat performance for the Nasdaq Composite. Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) has inked a 20-year power-purchase deal with Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG), securing electricity from the utility&#8217;s Illinois plant. This landmark deal marks the first direct partnership between a major tech company and the nuclear power industry. Large technology companies are hunting reliable access to the U.S. electricity grid, driven by the rapidly increasing energy demands of their AI-powered data centers. CEG shares are soaring 6%, while META stock is flat. Here&#8217;s a look at market performance this morning: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 26.87 (+0.06%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 11.54 (-0.06%) S&amp;P 500: Down 3.37 (-0.06%) Market Movers Automaker Ford (NYSE: F) experienced a 16.3% jump in sales last month compared with year-ago levels. The strong performance was fueled by an employee pricing program that Ford rolled out to offset the impact from tariffs and higher vehicle sticker prices. Dollar General (NYSE: DG) is rising 13.5% today after reporting better-than-expected Q1 financial results, including strong sales. The discount retailer also raised its full-year outlook, a move that is being cheered by the markets. Hims &amp; Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) is up 14% in today&#8217;s trading session after announcing its acquisition of a European digital health platform.

BMO&#8217;s optimism stems from President Trump&#8217;s plan to bolster U.S. nuclear energy production over the next few decades. Uranium Energy stock has climbed 11.1% higher today, amidst broader momentum within the nuclear power industry. S&amp;P 500 Forecast 10:23 am by Gerelyn Terzo Deutsche Bank is the latest Wall Street firm to revise its 2025 S&amp;P 500 forecast. Deutsche analyst Binky Chadha, who in early 2025 had a whopping 7,000 target on the broader market index, has lifted the firm&#8217;s S&amp;P 500 year-end target to 6,550 from 6,150 in a positive sign for the direction of the markets and trade deals.

Uncertainty continues to grip the markets as ongoing trade-related setbacks persist. After managing only a slight gain on Monday, equities are showing little clear direction today, with investors largely holding their breath for further developments on trade agreements. Reflecting this cautious sentiment, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has trimmed its growth projections for the U.S. economy, forecasting 1.6% for 2025 and 1.5% for 2026. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is up 0.03%. In a notable development, Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) has finalized a two-decade power-purchase agreement with Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG), securing electricity from the utility&#8217;s Illinois plant. This first-mover deal represents the first direct partnership between a major tech company and the nuclear power industry. Across the sector, large technology firms are actively seeking dependable access to the U.S. electricity grid, a necessity intensified by the rapidly escalating energy demands of their AI-powered data centers.

The company also uplifted its full-year outlook, a move that&#8217;s clearly being well-received by the markets.

META,2025-06-03 13:30:07,"These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-20250603.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points A &#8220;more is better&#8221; approach can help you diversify your portfolio while generating passive income. Five fascinating funds will tempt income seekers with potent yields and strong growth prospects. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Stock picking is fine, but exchange traded funds (ETFs) can enable immediate diversification without sacrificing growth and income opportunities. By selecting multiple funds instead of just one, you can achieve an extra measure of safety while also turning your portfolio into a veritable income-generating machine. The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/03/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-passive-income-machines/

You can try all four of these high-yield ETFs for diversified exposure to a wide range of stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In recent years, ultra-high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs) have opened the door to new possibilities for aggressive income harvesters. If you pick your ETFs carefully, you can practically turn your portfolio into a passive income machine. Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-passive-income-machines/

Citing people familiar with the plans, the report says advertisers will be able to provide a product image and budget, and Meta’s AI will handle everything from generating the content, including text, images and video, to targeting users across Facebook and Instagram. Meta already uses AI to customise ads and suggest variations, but the new tools would go further by offering real-time personalisation based on factors like location. The company is also working on automating budget recommendations. With 3.43 billion global users across its apps, Meta sees advanced AI tools as a way to deliver ad results at scale. The move comes as rivals such as Snap, Pinterest and Reddit ramp up their own AI offerings in an increasingly competitive digital ad market. atai Life Sciences (NASDAQ:ATAI, ETR:9VC) CEO and co-founder Dr Srinivas Rao talked with Proactive about the company’s clinical development progress in 2025, highlighting multiple upcoming trial readouts. Proactive: Hello, you're watching Proactive. Joining me is atai Life Sciences CEO and co-founder Dr Srinivas Rao. Srinivas, very good to speak with you. You've had a very busy start to 2025. Let's start off with the positive topline data of part two of the Beckley Psytech’s Phase 2a trial of BPL-003. It looks pretty encouraging. Dr Srinivas Rao: Yeah. Well, thanks for having me on. Yeah, we're very excited by that. So this is a continuation of a Phase 2a that we reported the results on last year actually. That was a single administration of BPL-003 in folks who were not taking an SSRI at that time. This is the continuation with those patients that are currently on an SSRI. Once again, we saw very good safety and tolerability and very robust efficacy in this cohort. So certainly important data as we move forward into Phase 3 with this program. The next step here is we're waiting for the results from the large Phase 2b trial that's currently ongoing. And if those results are as encouraging as the ones you just mentioned, when would you be expecting to go ahead with the Phase 3 trial? I mean, we haven't officially guided on that. And of course, the reason for that is it's going to depend upon the results as well as discussions with the FDA. But generally speaking, we can anticipate something starting sometime next year — obviously, sort of middle of next year, perhaps a little later. So you mentioned data from the Phase 2b study, which is expected in the middle of the year. Srinivas, lots of key readouts are expected this year and going into 2026. Take us through some of the other important ones. Yeah, we've got quite a few coming up. So we have the BPL-003 Phase 2b that we were talking about now — that's mid-year. RL-007, the large Phase 2b in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, also in the middle of this year. Sort of right on top of this one, we’ll see which one comes first. And then early next year, the VLS-01 Illumina study that's currently ongoing should be reading out as well. We just recently initiated a Phase 2a study of EMP-01 in social anxiety disorder. That too is expected to read out in the first quarter of next year. And you announced the dosing of the first patients in that EMP-01 trial. Srinivas, tell us more about the trial and what it’s targeted at? Yeah, I mean again, it's an exploratory study. We wanted to go after a different indication. There's really no one focused on social anxiety disorder currently with a psychedelic compound. It’s using EMP-01, which we had reported results on in January or so last year. From our Phase 1, we found some very interesting properties of that compound — specifically that it had these antiketogenic effects like MDMA, but it also had psychedelic effects as well. So, a really interesting profile — a blend of these two classes in many ways. We spent time looking for the appropriate indication for that and ultimately made the decision to move forward with social anxiety disorder. There is some limited data for MDMA in social anxiety disorder, particularly in the autism subset, where social anxiety disorder is quite prominent. We are looking at broader social anxiety disorder with this. The trial broadly is a six-week study, with two administrations of EMP-01 — on day one and then at week four — and then a readout at week six. We're using a regulatory endpoint there, the so-called Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Again, very excited to see how this drug performs in this really important patient population, one that has a huge unmet medical need — bigger than depression — and yet has very limited options, at least from the therapeutic options for the treatment. Srinivas, apart from all of those readouts, any other milestones that your investors should be looking out for as 2025 progresses? I think in terms of the things that people will be really focused on, those are the main ones. The readouts are obviously the key right now. Obviously, there are other readouts in the space that we're all looking at. Compass being an important one. We do remain a shareholder in Compass. They have an interim readout that is also middle of this year. First quarter of next year, I believe, is when the totality of the so-called 005 study will read out. So again, that's going to be a big one for the space, of course.

(NASDAQ: META) gained 2.07% over the past five trading sessions, continuing a rally that began on April 21. Since then, the stock is up 33.24%, bringing its year-to-date gain to 7.79% and its one-year gain to 34.58%, as the markets remain optimistic in the wake of the 90-day tariff pause between the U.S. and China announced on Sunday, May 11. Despite mixed results from its Q1 earnings announcement — Meta Platforms missed on EPS and beat on revenue — increased user engagement and expansion of its AI tools continue to encourage investors looking down the road. In the wake of last month&#8217;s earnings call, Barclays lowered its price target on Meta to $640 from $705, keeping its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. On the other hand, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley all raised their price targets for Meta, to $690, $690, $675 and $650, respectively, while all maintaining their &#8220;Buy&#8221; or &#8220;Overweight&#8221; ratings. There are headwinds, of course. The company remains embroiled in legal issues. Last month, Meta&#8217;s former Director of Global Public Policy Sarah Wynn-Williams testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee after making claims that the company undermined U.S. national security by briefing Chinese officials on emerging technologies like artificial intelligence — a claim that she said has contributed to Meta&#8217;s $18 billion business in China. The company remains embroiled in antitrust legal challenges, which may impact its forward guidance. Additionally, on March 24, the European Union (EU) announced plans to penalize Meta with a fine of up to $1 billion for breaching strict antitrust rules after the EU&#8217;s antitrust watchdog — the European Commission — found that the company is not in compliance with the Digital Markets Act. Earlier this year, META announced — alongside authorizing a $50 billion stock buyback — that shares of META would begin paying a dividend. And while its current yield of 0.33% may not seem like much, at its current price, that equates to $0.53 per share quarterly, or $2.12 per share annualized. As the dominant player in the social media landscape, Meta Platforms is now branching out more broadly into tech, and specifically, the artificial intelligence (AI) space. It is the latter that the company is most heavily investing in now, and for that reason, it is also the primary driver of 24/7 Wall St. price predictions and forecasts for 2025–2030. Key Points in This Article: &#8220;Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,&#8221; according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 24/7 Wall St. projects a 51.53% upside potential for the stock through the end of the decade.

Meta Platforms&#8217; 10-Year Results Here&#8217;s a table summarizing the performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) of META stock from 2014 to 2024: Year Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $80.78 $12.466 $2.940 2015 $104.66 $17.928 $3.688 2016 $115.05 $27.638 $10.217 2017 $176.46 $40.653 $15.934 2018 $133.20 $55.838 $22.112 2019 $208.10 $70.697 $18.485 2020 $273.16 $85.965 $29.146 2021 $336.35 $117.929 $39.370 2022 $120.34 $116.609 $23.200 2023 $353.96 $134.902 $39.098 2024 $599.24 $164.501 $62.36 *Revenue and net income in $billions From 2014 to 2024, Meta Platforms&#8217; revenue grew 1,196.16% from $12.466 billion to over $164 billion, while its net income went from $2.940 billion to over $62.36 billion. The primary driver of that growth over that decade was ad space for the company&#8217;s social media platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Reel and WhatsApp, among others. While Meta Platforms has branched out into augmented reality and virtual reality — a business segment it refers to as Reality Labs — 99% of its revenue generation comes from its Family of Apps business segment, as of year-end 2023. But as the company looks to the second half of the decade, Zuckerberg and the company will focus on a few key focus areas that will have a large impact on Meta Platforms&#8217; stock performance. Key Drivers of Meta Platforms&#8217; Stock Performance 1. AI Investment: Founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta Platforms &#8220;released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we&#8217;re driving good growth across our apps.&#8221; While the market for Meta&#8217;s social media advertising remains healthy and continues to drive the majority of the company&#8217;s revenue, it is focusing heavily on AI investments to expand through the end of the decade. Price-per-ad revenue saw a 10% year-over-year gain, and that success will fund its AI spending aimed at future growth. CFO Susan Li stated that META expects &#8220;significant capital expenditure growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.&#8221; In its Q1 earnings call, the company announced that 30% more advertisers were using its AI creative tools, and its new ads recommendation model increased conversion rates by 5% for reels. 2. Continued Renewable Energy Development: According to the company&#8217;s net zero plan, which it is aiming to achieve by 2030, &#8220;Since 2020, Meta&#8217;s global operations have been supported by 100% renewable energy. As of 2023, we have 10,000MW of contracted renewable energy across six countries.&#8221; As part of its net zero plan, Meta Platforms&#8217; reliance on renewable energy will ultimately decrease the cost of its utility expenses, and ultimately, its carbon footprint through contracted and self-employed green technologies. Renewables already cost less than fossil fuel energy sources, and according to Canary Media, &#8220;By 2030, technology improvements could slash today&#8217;s prices by a quarter for wind and by half for solar.&#8221; The company has announced that its goal for its forthcoming data center is that it is 100% sustainable and net zero. 3. Focusing on Growing Free Cash Flow: Zuckerberg labeled 2023 Meta Platforms&#8217; &#8220;year of efficiency,&#8221; and their results were staggering. By year-end, the company recorded a record free cash flow of $43 billion. That is up from $21 billion in 2019, marking a nearly 105% increase in its cash position in four years. Meta&#8217;s free cash flow in 2024 stood at $52.1, another record that showed the company&#8217;s focus on its bottom line is driving decisions from the top down and has increasingly strong results. Meta Platforms (META) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current median one-year price target for Meta Platforms is $696.12, which represents 7.79% upside potential from today&#8217;s share price. Of the 45 analysts covering META stock, it receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating with 41 analysts assigning it as a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; three assigning it as a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and one assigning it as a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; However, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s forecast is more bullish, projecting Meta Platforms&#8217; stock price to be $729.55 based on the company&#8217;s ability to sustain its strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency, which in turn will drive its bottom line despite capital expenditures increasing toward its AI objectives. That price target represents potential upside of 12.97% from today&#8217;s share price. Meta Platforms (META) Stock Estimates 2025-2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2024 $161.579 $54.960 $21.18 2025 $183.459 $62.250 $24.12 2026 $205.257 $70.680 $27.71 2027 $226.332 $78.258 $30.42 2028 $245.319 $85.912 $32.38 2029 $268.306 $97.044 $36.54 2030 $274.947 $91.227 $39.70 *Revenue and net income in $billions META Platforms (META) Price Prediction 2025–2030 By the end of the start of the next decade, we forecast that META’s stock price will reach $1,216.82, or 88.43% higher than it is trading for today, despite estimates that net income will pull back slightly from over $97 billion to over $91 billion.

Great Expectations 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo A cautious tone persists in today&#8217;s trading, with the three major stock market averages slightly in the red. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) shares are up 0.33% ahead of its highly anticipated quarterly earnings report expected after the closing bell. The prevailing sentiment is that Nvidia will once again exceed expectations and upgrade its guidance due to strong AI and chip demand. Yet, concerns linger regarding a potential write-down linked to China revenues, even with overall strong demand. The SPY ETF is lower by 0.16%. Consumer Spending on Deck 10:49 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive greater insight on the resilience of the consumer this week. Personal Income and Spending data for April is due out on Friday. This data follows a period of robust consumer spending observed in March. Economists at Wells Fargo anticipate a 0.3% increase in personal income and a 0.2% rise in personal spending. SPY is currently lower by 0.24%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets are treading carefully today, following yesterday&#8217;s powerful surge driven by news of EU import tariff delays. The spotlight is now firmly on corporate earnings, particularly those of chip giant Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), whose highly anticipated quarterly results are due after the market closes. Early morning trading shows stocks with minimal direction, as the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all registering modest gains. The SPY ETF is down 0.11% as of mid-morning trading. Here&#8217;s a look at the SPY over the past five trading sessions: The &#8220;Magnificent Seven&#8221; stocks are largely flat, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) up 1% and the rest of the cohort seeing mixed trading. GameStop (NYSE: GME) has dipped 3.5% today after venturing into the cryptocurrency space with its initial bitcoin acquisition exceeding $500 million, mirroring moves by MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has offloaded some TSLA shares while increasing its stake in Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings announcement. Elon Musk attempted to soothe investor concerns by posting about his relentless work schedule. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 22.97 (-0.05%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 9.71 (-0.05%) S&amp;P 500: Down 2.27 (-0.04%) Market Movers Retailer Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) is down 2.7% today, having cut its profit outlook amidst tariff-related challenges and cautious consumer sentiment. Conversely, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) is surging by 25.9% after easily beating its first-quarter earnings estimates. Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY), an electric air taxi firm, has climbed 26% following a $250 million strategic investment from automaker Toyota Motor. After initially rising above $127 per share, identity management company Okta (Nasdaq: OKTA) is now down 12% in the wake of its quarterly results, experiencing profit-taking. Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE: FICO) is recovering recent losses and is up 6.8% today.

Biotech Benefits from Generative AI 2:02 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Jefferies believes certain biotechnology stocks are poised to benefit from AI advancements. Analyst Michael Yee told CNBC that the sector is likely to save billions of dollars as well as time in getting drugs to market thanks to the role of generative AI in drug discovery. The firm is bullish on biotech stocks for the rest of 2025, saying any bad news is already built into the sector. The Nasdaq Composite is basically flat ahead of Nvidia&#8217;s earnings. Market Update 12:33 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks are continuing to play it safe in today&#8217;s trading session, with the three major stock market averages fractionally lower across the board. VP JD Vance is headlining today&#8217;s Bitcoin 2025 event, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift the BTC price, which is up about 0.17%. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock is up 0.33% today ahead of its quarterly earnings report due out this afternoon. The markets have come to expect Nvidia beating expectations and raising its guidance on strong AI and chip demand. Demand has been strong, but one area of concern is a write-down tied to China revenues. The Nasdaq Composite is currently down 0.09%. Personal Income &amp; Spending Preview 10:38 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive another dose of economic data on Friday when the Personal Income and Spending report for the month of April is released. The report will come on the heels of strong consumer spending in March. Wells Fargo economists forecast personal income growth of 0.3% and personal spending to rise 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.18%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are playing it cautious following yesterday&#8217;s strong rally fueled by EU import tariff delays. Today all eyes are on corporate America, more specifically semiconductor leader Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), which reports its highly anticipated quarterly results after the closing bell. Stocks are showing little conviction in early morning trading, with the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posting fractional gains. The Magnificent Seven stocks are little changed, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) posting a 1% gain and the rest of the group trading mixed. GameStop (NYSE: GME) is down 3.5% on the day after expanding its footprint into the cryptocurrency markets with its maiden bitcoin purchase worth over $500 million, taking a page from the books of MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has unloaded some TSLA shares while buying more Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings report. Elon Musk attempted to reassure investors by posting that he is working around the clock. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 54.20 (+0.13%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 43.57 (+0.23%) S&amp;P 500: Up 9.99 (+0.17%) Market Movers Retailer Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) is down 2.7% today after slashing its profit forecast amid tariff-related headwinds and consumer skittishness.

Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY), an electric air taxi company, is up 26% after receiving a $250 million strategic investment from automaker Toyota Motor. After the stock initially climbed above $127 per share, Identity management company Okta (Nasdaq: OKTA) is experiencing a 12% decline on the heels of its quarterly results amid profit taking.

Both stocks have rallied by double-digit percentages in recent days. President Trump is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and tighten the window for new reactor license approvals to 18 months, a process that traditionally is infamous for being extremely lengthy. The markets are holding their gains, including a 2.1% advance in the Nasdaq Composite. Consumer Confidence Soars 10:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer Confidence surged in May, hitting 98 – a significant 12.3-point jump from April. This robust reading defied economists&#8217; predictions of 86, despite ongoing tariff concerns. The markets are widening their lead, including a nearly 2% jump in the Nasdaq Composite. Durable Goods Orders Reverse 9:55 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders fell 6.3% last month, a narrower decline than economists had anticipated but on the heels of four straight monthly increases. The latest data is a gauge on business spending in light of the tariffs. Boeing (NYSE: BA) orders were a drag, falling 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Optimism has seeped back into the markets, with all three of the major stock market averages coming out of the gate higher. President Trump announced a pause on proposed EU tariffs until July 9, fueling a 300-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Technology stocks are leading the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 each higher by over 1%. The proposed EU import tariff continues to hover at 50%, and July isn&#8217;t too far away, but for now, the markets are seeing the glass as half full. The Trump administration&#8217;s deal with the EU suggests further trade partner progress could be revealed sooner than later. Wall Street firm Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock ahead of the AI darling&#8217;s highly anticipated quarterly results due out tomorrow, advising investors to stay long on the stock and weather the uncertainty because the worst is behind them. Other Mag 7 stocks are higher today as well, including Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), each with a 1% jump. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is rallying 3.5% after Wedbush analysts labeled the EV maker an AI &#8220;pure play&#8221; and lifted the price target to $500 per share. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 378.17 (+0.89%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 275.40 (+1.5%) S&amp;P 500: Up 65.67 (+1.1%) Market Movers UBS has upgraded shares of LifeStance Health (Nasdaq: LFST) to a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on a bullish long-term outlook, sending the stock up 4%.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) will begin charging customers $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second later this week, a reversal of a longstanding &#8220;bags fly free&#8221; policy for the airline.

Both stocks have risen by double-digit percentages since President Trump issued an executive order last week. The president is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and shorten the wait for new reactor license approvals to one and a half years, a process that historically is known for moving at a snail&#8217;s pace. Business Orders Soften 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders posted a 6.3% decline last month, a softer drop than economists had predicted. However, this dip follows four consecutive months of increases, painting a mixed picture for business spending amid ongoing tariff discussions. A significant drag on the overall figures was Boeing (NYSE: BA), whose orders plunged 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Market sentiment has turned decidedly upbeat, with all three major stock market averages seeing gains from the open. President Trump agreed to delay proposed EU tariffs until July 9, which led to a 300-point jump for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also buoying stocks is the latest round of economic data. Consumer Confidence for May came in at a stronger than expected reading of 98, up 12.3 points month-over-month. Economists were calling for a reading of 86 in the face of tariffs. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is gaining 1.45% on the day. Technology stocks powering the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 up by over 1% each. Despite the pending 50% EU import tariff and July being right around the corner, markets are satisfied with the interim relief, viewing the Trump administration&#8217;s agreement with the EU as a potential precursor to further positive trade developments. Wall Street firm Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) ahead of the AI darling&#8217;s crucial quarterly results tomorrow. The firm suggests investors hold fast, believing the most challenging period is now behind the company.

Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stands out with a 3.5% rally after Wedbush analysts elevated the EV manufacturer to an AI &#8220;pure play&#8221; and boosted its price target to $500 per share.

(NASDAQ: META) were mostly flat through a.m. trading on Wednesday as the stock took a breather after its recent run-up saw a gain of 31.24% over the past month. That brings META&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 6.25%, and its one-year gain to 37.07%, as the markets remain optimistic in the wake of the 90-day tariff pause between the U.S. and China announced on Sunday, May 11. Despite mixed results from its Q1 earnings announcement — Meta Platforms missed on EPS and beat on revenue — increased user engagement and expansion of its AI tools continue to encourage investors looking down the road. In the wake of last month&#8217;s earnings call, Barclays lowered its price target on Meta to $640 from $705, keeping its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. On the other hand, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley all raised their price targets for Meta, to $690, $690, $675 and $650, respectively, while all maintaining their &#8220;Buy&#8221; or &#8220;Overweight&#8221; ratings. There are headwinds, of course. The company remains embroiled in legal issues. Meta&#8217;s former Director of Global Public Policy Sarah Wynn-Williams recently testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee after making claims that the company undermined U.S. national security by briefing Chinese officials on emerging technologies like artificial intelligence — a claim that she said has contributed to Meta&#8217;s $18 billion business in China. The company remains embroiled in antitrust legal challenges, which may impact its forward guidance. Additionally, on March 24, the European Union (EU) announced plans to penalize Meta with a fine of up to $1 billion for breaching strict antitrust rules after the EU&#8217;s antitrust watchdog — the European Commission — found that the company is not in compliance with the Digital Markets Act. Earlier this year, META announced — alongside authorizing a $50 billion stock buyback — that shares of META would begin paying a dividend. And while its current yield of 0.32% may not seem like much, at its current price, that equates to $0.53 per share quarterly, or $2.12 per share annualized. As the dominant player in the social media landscape, Meta Platforms is now branching out more broadly into tech, and specifically, the artificial intelligence (AI) space. It is the latter that the company is most heavily investing in now, and for that reason, it is also the primary driver of 24/7 Wall St. price predictions and forecasts for 2025–2030. Key Points in This Article: &#8220;Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,&#8221; according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 24/7 Wall St. projects a 51.53% upside potential for the stock through the end of the decade.

Meta Platforms&#8217; 10-Year Results Here&#8217;s a table summarizing the performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) of META stock from 2014 to 2024: Year Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $80.78 $12.466 $2.940 2015 $104.66 $17.928 $3.688 2016 $115.05 $27.638 $10.217 2017 $176.46 $40.653 $15.934 2018 $133.20 $55.838 $22.112 2019 $208.10 $70.697 $18.485 2020 $273.16 $85.965 $29.146 2021 $336.35 $117.929 $39.370 2022 $120.34 $116.609 $23.200 2023 $353.96 $134.902 $39.098 2024 $599.24 $164.501 $62.36 *Revenue and net income in $billions From 2014 to 2024, Meta Platforms&#8217; revenue grew 1,196.16% from $12.466 billion to over $164 billion, while its net income went from $2.940 billion to over $62.36 billion. The primary driver of that growth over that decade was ad space for the company&#8217;s social media platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Reel and WhatsApp, among others. While Meta Platforms has branched out into augmented reality and virtual reality — a business segment it refers to as Reality Labs — 99% of its revenue generation comes from its Family of Apps business segment, as of year-end 2023. But as the company looks to the second half of the decade, Zuckerberg and the company will focus on a few key focus areas that will have a large impact on Meta Platforms&#8217; stock performance. Key Drivers of Meta Platforms&#8217; Stock Performance 1. AI Investment: Founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta Platforms &#8220;released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we&#8217;re driving good growth across our apps.&#8221; While the market for Meta&#8217;s social media advertising remains healthy and continues to drive the majority of the company&#8217;s revenue, it is focusing heavily on AI investments to expand through the end of the decade. Price-per-ad revenue saw a 10% year-over-year gain, and that success will fund its AI spending aimed at future growth. CFO Susan Li stated that META expects &#8220;significant capital expenditure growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.&#8221; In its Q1 earnings call, the company announced that 30% more advertisers were using its AI creative tools, and its new ads recommendation model increased conversion rates by 5% for reels. 2. Continued Renewable Energy Development: According to the company&#8217;s net zero plan, which it is aiming to achieve by 2030, &#8220;Since 2020, Meta&#8217;s global operations have been supported by 100% renewable energy. As of 2023, we have 10,000MW of contracted renewable energy across six countries.&#8221; As part of its net zero plan, Meta Platforms&#8217; reliance on renewable energy will ultimately decrease the cost of its utility expenses, and ultimately, its carbon footprint through contracted and self-employed green technologies. Renewables already cost less than fossil fuel energy sources, and according to Canary Media, &#8220;By 2030, technology improvements could slash today&#8217;s prices by a quarter for wind and by half for solar.&#8221; The company has announced that its goal for its forthcoming data center is that it is 100% sustainable and net zero. 3. Focusing on Growing Free Cash Flow: Zuckerberg labeled 2023 Meta Platforms&#8217; &#8220;year of efficiency,&#8221; and their results were staggering. By year-end, the company recorded a record free cash flow of $43 billion. That is up from $21 billion in 2019, marking a nearly 105% increase in its cash position in four years. Meta&#8217;s free cash flow in 2024 stood at $52.1, another record that showed the company&#8217;s focus on its bottom line is driving decisions from the top down and has increasingly strong results. Meta Platforms (META) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current median one-year price target for Meta Platforms is $696.12, which represents 9.42% upside potential from today&#8217;s share price. Of the 45 analysts covering META stock, it receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating with 41 analysts assigning it as a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; three assigning it as a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and one assigning it as a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; However, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s forecast is more bullish, projecting Meta Platforms&#8217; stock price to be $729.55 based on the company&#8217;s ability to sustain its strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency, which in turn will drive its bottom line despite capital expenditures increasing toward its AI objectives. That price target represents potential upside of 14.67% from today&#8217;s share price.

META,2025-05-13 08:00:04,The Stock Market Crash That Could Ruin Everything,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-stock-market-crash-that-could-ruin-everything-20250513.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"The stock market had a 20% reset in April, which lasted only a few days, if even that. Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.

After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

Just past 3 p.m., Capital Region Fire Dispatch began receiving reports of a shed fire spreading to a garage on Chase Farm Road in Hopkinton. Fire spotters at the Kearsarge fire tower also reported seeing plumes of smoke from the area, a little more than a mile from the town’s border with Concord. Firefighters from Hopkinton, Concord, Warner, and Webster were sent to the scene. A few minutes later, a second alarm was struck, sending engines and tankers from Bow, Henniker, Hooksett, Salisbury, Weare, and Webster to the fires. The fire commander reported several vehicles were on fire and they would need to use Deer Meadow Brook, a nearby water source next to the town dump, to bring the fire under control. Forestry units were requested as well as Eversource, to shut down power to the scene. A porta-pond was also set up to collect water from the brook and create a holding tank. Around 3:15 p.m., the fire commander called for a “modified brush assignment” and said firefighters would need help keeping a brush fire from spreading to a nearby house. More firefighters, tankers, and forestry units from Allenstown, Concord, Dunbarton, Henniker, Hillsboro, and Warner were requested. Fifteen minutes later, a second alarm for the brush fire was requested, and more firefighters, tankers, and forestry units from Bradford, Canterbury, Franklin, and Pembroke were sent to the scene. Around 4:45 p.m., the fire commander said most of the brush fire was extinguished while firefighters were still trying to contain hot spots on the buildings. Firefighters began breaking down equipment and wrapping up around 5:30 p.m. News 603 posted several videos on Facebook.  Video 2:  Video 3:  Video 4:  Do you have a news tip?

UnitedHealth Group stock has been a weight on the Dow and S&amp;P 500 today after its worrying quarterly results and outlook. Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON), which is part of the Nasdaq Composite, is gaining over 2% on the day. The company reports its quarterly results on April 29. The company is in the midst of spinning off a couple of business divisions, and the stock is nearing the $200 per share level. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is down 1% after BMO Capital cut its price target on the stock to $200 per share, which still represents upside from current levels of $151 per share. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is gaining 1.5% on the day as the company expands its chip footprint in the auto sector. Market Gains Slip 8:17 am The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are struggling to keep their grip on gains after coming out of the gate higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains pressured with a 1.2% loss on the day. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) stock is a major drag on the Dow, owing to disappointing quarterly results, while CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) remains a bright spot, rising 1.2% on the day. Chip stock Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) is up nearly 1% this morning on a bullish report out of Citi analysts. Sector performance is largely positive, led by a 2.4% gain in energy stocks but dampened by a tech sector that has just turned south. After yesterday&#8217;s massive technology sell-off, the markets are licking their wounds, with the three major stock market averages giving a mixed showing. Among the gainers is the Nasdaq Composite with a 0.63% advance and the S&amp;P 500 also fractionally higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently erasing over 400 points. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, a complete reversal from yesterday&#8217;s leader board. The markets are still processing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments from yesterday, which were on the hawkish side of monetary policy. Earnings are capturing some attention away from tariffs with railway CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) gaining 1% on the heels of its Q1 print. CSX faced challenges in the quarter, including a 7% year-over-year decline in revenue, but met consensus expectations amid a backdrop of weaker coal prices and dwindling fuel surcharges. Big Tech is mostly showing green this morning but remains mired in losses over the past five-day stretch, including a 2% drop in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), 14% decline in Meta (Nasdaq: META) and nearly 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) over the past week or so. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) is a big drag on the Dow, shaving off 18% of its value today alone on disappointing earnings results. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 446 (-1.09%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 118.75 (+0.65%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22 (+0.41%) Market Movers Qualcomm (Nasdaq; QCOM) is rising today on the heels of a bullish report out of Citi analysts, who reportedly raised estimates on the company and added it to their positive catalyst watchlist thanks to robust demand for its chipsets out of China. QCOM stock has been volatile and is down 11% year-to-date. Citi also likes Generac Holdings (Nasdaq: GNRC), upgrading the stock to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a &#8220;high-risk&#8221; tone from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; BMO has upgraded shares of wood producer (NYSE: TREX) Trex to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; calling shares attractive.

Ever since President Donald Trump announced his policy of reciprocal tariffs to level the international trade playing field, the stock and bond markets have both become cyclonic in their volatility. 2,000+ point intraday swings in either direction on the Dow Jones Average and a 50 basis point swing for the 10-year Treasury Bond yield in less than a month have given even veteran investors bouts of nausea. As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Navigating Through A Huge Menu Of Selections The huge array of available investment selections can be intimidating and overwhelming neophyte investors. A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action.

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.

Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) is the lead EU regulator for X due to the location of its EU operations in the country. It has the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company's global revenue under the EU's strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); The inquiry will look at ""the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts posted on the X social media platform by EU/EEA users, for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models,"" the DPC said in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump and other members of his administration have criticised EU regulation of U.S. companies and described fines imposed on U.S. tech companies by the EU as a form of taxation. X owner Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a top adviser to Trump, has also railed against EU regulations, mainly those imposed directly by Brussels on online content. The decision follows a court case last year in which the Irish regulator sought an order to restrict X from processing the data of EU users for the purposes of developing its AI systems. X agreed to stop training its AI systems using personal data collected from EU users before they had the option to withdraw their consent. The Irish regulator ended its court proceedings weeks later, saying X had agreed the limits on a permanent basis. The powerful Irish privacy regulator has fined the likes of Microsoft's LinkedIn, TikTok and Meta since it was given sanctioning powers in 2018. Its fines to date of Meta total almost 3 billion euros. X, or Twitter as it was then called, has not faced sanctions since the DPC fined it 450,000 euros ($511,000) in 2020, the first penalty the regulator handed out under the new data privacy system.

META,2025-04-02 11:04:39,New AI benchmarks test speed of running AI applications,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/new-ai-benchmarks-test-speed-of-running-ai-applications-20250402.jpg,https://www.marketscreener.com,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence group MLCommons unveiled two new benchmarks that it said can help determine how quickly top-of-the-line hardware and software can run AI applications. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT over two years ago, chip companies have begun to shift their focus to making hardware that can efficiently run the code that allows millions of people to use AI tools. As the underlying models must respond to many more queries to power AI applications such as chatbots and search engines, MLCommons developed two new versions of its MLPerf benchmarks to gauge speed. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); One of the new benchmarks is based on Meta's so-called Llama 3.1 405-billion-parameter AI model, and the test targets general question answering, math and code generation. The new format tests a system's ability to process large queries and synthesize data from multiple sources. Nvidia submitted several of its chips for the benchmark, and so did system builders such as Dell Technologies. There were no Advanced Micro Devices submissions for the large 405-billion-parameter benchmark, according to data provided by MLCommons. For the new test, Nvidia's latest generation of artificial intelligence servers - called Grace Blackwell, which have 72 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) inside - was 2.8 to 3.4 times faster than the previous generation, even when only using eight GPUs in the newer server to create a direct comparison to the older model, the company said at a briefing on Tuesday. Nvidia has been working to speed up the connections of chips inside its servers, which is important in AI work where a chatbot runs on multiple chips at once. The second benchmark is also based on an open-source AI model built by Meta and the test aims to more closely simulate the performance expectations set by consumer AI applications such as ChatGPT. The goal is to tighten the response time for the benchmark and make it close to an instant response. (Reporting by Max A.

He&#8217;s considering relocating, but he likely should keep his high paying job as long as he can. Shoring up his finances and starting to network for other work could help him maintain financial stability. Earn up to 3.8% on your money today (and get a cash bonus); click here to see how. (Sponsored) A Canadian working at a FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) job is currently making $700K per year while his pregnant wife stays home with the couple&#8217;s toddler. Unfortunately, as he posted on Reddit, he&#8217;s worried about potential layoffs at his company. He wasn&#8217;t given a promotion this year as the company was laying people off, and he&#8217;s also been unable to get a visa due to the layoffs. He&#8217;s also concerned that his temporary visa could be ended because of a potential trade war between the U.S. and Canada. Given the uncertainty about his professional future, he&#8217;s trying to decide what to do. He&#8217;s thinking about potentially selling his houses in the U.S. at a small loss and resettling in Canada; about paying down his mortgage so he&#8217;d earn enough rent to cover it and temporarily going to Canada or India and renting until things stabilize in the U.S.; or about just trying to hold on at work while expanding his emergency fund. So, what&#8217;s the best approach for him to deal with his current workplace uncertainty? Shoring up his finances and work skills could be a good option While the Reddit user may be worried about future layoffs, the fact is that he has not been laid off yet &#8212; and he is still making a $700K per year income. Giving up that job in anticipation of a possible layoff that may never come would likely be a foolish move. Instead, he can focus on making himself as indispensable as possible at work. While this may not guarantee he won&#8217;t be laid off, it still gives him a better shot at staying on the job and continuing to earn great pay. He can also start polishing up his resume, networking, and making professional connections. With a FAANG job as part of his employment history, he may easily be able to find other work in the U.S. even if he is laid off from his current position. This could help him to avoid having to sell his houses and disrupt his family just because of short-term economic issues. Regardless, since his job is uncertain, shoring up his financial situation would be a smart move. He should throw as much money as possible into a high-yield savings account right now. That way, this money will be there for him to live on temporarily if he loses his job. If he does end up having to move back to Canada because of problems with his visa resulting from a trade war, it would also be helpful to have these extra funds to pay for any costs. Since he really can&#8217;t predict the future, taking these steps to be as financially secure as possible, while keeping his high-paying job for as long as he can, should help set him up for a more secure future. A financial advisor can also help him find ways to free up more money to save and can also work with him to make different contingency plans and understand how they would impact his finances, so getting this professional advice would likely be a smart choice given the uncertainty of his ongoing situation.
