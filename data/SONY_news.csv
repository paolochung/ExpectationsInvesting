This market has grown significantly in recent years, driven by increased demand for enhanced audio quality in home entertainment systems. As televisions become thinner and more advanced, their built-in speakers often fail to deliver the robust sound that modern consumers expect. This has led to a rising demand for external audio solutions, with these emerging as a popular choice. Recent developments in the Mexican market include introducing more budget-friendly models by brands like Samsung and LG, catering to the growing middle class. As smart TVs become more common in Mexican households, these are viewed as an affordable way to enhance audio quality without investing in expensive home theater setups.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/15/2982067/28124/en/North-America-Soundbar-Market-and-Competition-Analysis-2024-2031-Featuring-Strategic-Profiles-of-Bose-Sony-Intex-Technologies-Yamaha-Samsung-Electronics-and-Other-Key-Players.html
