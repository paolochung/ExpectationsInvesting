As we&#8217;ve noted in prior updates, this likely is due to lower-than-expected billings guidance. The punishment to the stock is harsher than we would have imagined given these results. One positive to take away from the quarter if you&#8217;re a long-term holder of DocuSign: the company raised its share repurchase program by a billion dollars. Digging into Why DocuSign is Down 4:31 pm by Joel South One key reason DocuSign is down after-hours: the company now expects billings to come in between $3.28 and $3.34 bllion. Previously, the company had guided to $3.3 billion to $3.35 billion. That&#8217;s a slight decrease, but for a company where the main concern weighing on shares is future growth expectations, billings moving in the wrong direction paints a picture of more headwinds to come. Earnings are Out and Docusign is Down 15% 4:25 pm by Eric Bleeker DocuSign beat on revenue and EPS last quarter (posting $.90 versus estimates of $.81). In addition, full year guidance was slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations, yet the stock is down 15%. We&#8217;ll keep digging into what&#8217;s going on during this live blog. Strategic Narrative &amp; Positioning 3:33 pm by Joel South DocuSign continues to reposition itself as more than an e-signature vendor — aiming to be the system of agreement for enterprise workflows. The company is embedding AI across its product stack, pitching productivity and risk-reduction to procurement, legal, and sales teams. However, this repositioning is still in transition. AI feature adoption is early, pricing clarity is limited, and competitive encroachment from Adobe and Microsoft remains a structural headwind. With net retention flat and billings growth trailing revenue, DOCU’s path to reacceleration is uncertain. The bull case hinges on enterprise AI monetization and international growth, while the bear case focuses on mid-single-digit topline and eroding operating leverage. Until a clearer inflection emerges, valuation is likely to remain range-bound. Keys to Watch 3:32 pm by Joel South GenAI Uptake &amp; Monetization: DOCU has leaned into AI with summarization, clause prediction, and document prep tools. While these features are promising, the company has yet to disclose attach or monetization metrics. How and when these tools drive upsell or pricing power is critical to the bull case. Billings vs. Revenue Divergence: The miss on Q1 billings and the tepid full-year billings guide stand in contrast to stable revenue growth. This raises questions about deal cycles, pricing pressure, and pipeline visibility. Investors will be watching closely for signs of large-deal delays or ASP compression. Margin Management Amid FX Headwinds: Despite a solid FCF quarter, DOCU is guiding for lower operating margins in FY25. Execution on cost control while investing in AI and international expansion will be key to preserving profitability. Core Results &amp; Financial Highlights 3:31 pm by Joel South Q1 Financials vs. Consensus: Revenue: $710M vs. $707M est. EPS (adj.): $0.82 vs. $0.79 est. Billings: $709M vs. ~$720M est. (soft) Non-GAAP Operating Margin: 22% FCF: $211M (30% FCF margin) Customer Metrics: Total customers: 1.49M (+10% YoY) Enterprise/commercial mix improving International now 26% of total revenue Retention remains stable with net revenue retention at 100%, down slightly but consistent with expectations. Enterprise renewal rates improved modestly, partially offsetting SMB softness. Expenses were well managed. R&amp;D and S&amp;M both came in slightly below plan, helping support EPS upside. However, management noted headwinds from FX and wage inflation as reasons for the lower full-year margin guide. DocuSign (Nasdaq: DOCU) delivered Q1 results that modestly outperformed consensus, but the stock traded lower post-earnings due to cautious forward billings guidance and a mixed margin profile. Revenue grew 7% YoY to $710M (vs. $707M est.), and EPS came in at $0.82 (vs. $0.79 est.), driven by lower-than-expected opex and stable gross margin. However, billings rose just 5% YoY to $709M, and full-year billings guidance of $2.93B–$2.96B implies a further slowdown. Management reaffirmed full-year revenue guidance of $2.76B–$2.78B, consistent with the ~7% topline growth pace, but operating margins are expected to contract to 21–22% from 23% in FY24. AI was a key focus. DocuSign flagged early adoption of new GenAI features like AI-powered document summarization, clause suggestions, and identity verification tools. While uptake metrics were not disclosed, management emphasized positive early feedback and embedded value in enterprise renewals. Despite the operational progress, the stock fell after hours as investors reacted to a reaffirmed full-year guide with no upward revisions and a weaker Q2 billings outlook. Shares remain in a volatile range, with YTD gains now mostly erased.

MSFT,2025-06-06 10:43:48,Rubrik (RBRK) Earnings Live:,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/rubrik-rbrk-earnings-live-20250606.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Rubrik the Rare Winner Tonight 5:04 pm by Joel South Tonight&#8217;s most anticipated earnings have generally been dreary. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign down 16%, and Broadcom is down 4%. So, perhaps its not surprising that after initial gains of 6%, shares of Rubrick are now flat after-hours as of 5:05 p.m. ET. The company still has its earnings call, but after a furious rally in stocks across the past two months, expectations for earnings have clearly risen. Shares Surge on Strong Earnings 4:34 pm by Joel South Shares of RBRK soared in after-hours trading after reporting strong Q1 results. The stock is up 6.02% since the close. Rubrik kicked off its FY 2026 with impressive Q1 results, exceeding all guided metrics and showcasing strong growth across key areas. The cyber resilience company reported a 49% year-over-year revenue increase to $278.5 million and a 38% rise in subscription annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $1.18 billion. The company now has 2,381 customers generating over $100K in subscription ARR, up 28% from the prior year. CEO Bipul Sinha credited the results to focused innovation and execution, while CFO Kiran Choudary highlighted ongoing progress toward profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin improved to 80.5%, and free cash flow turned positive at $33.3 million. Rubrik also announced major partnerships with Google Cloud, Deloitte, NTT Data and Rackspace to expand its data protection and AI security offerings. Looking ahead, Rubrik projects Q2 revenue between $281 million and $283 million and expects full-year revenue to reach up to $1.19 billion. Risks 3:32 pm 1. Channel Saturation and GTM Efficiency PressureRubrik is scaling fast, but sales and marketing spend remains high. If CAC payback extends or sales cycles elongate — especially in regulated verticals — investors may question whether the growth is too expensive. High cash burn without operating leverage risks a rerating, even if ARR expands. 2. Competitive Intensity and Pricing RiskRubrik competes with Veeam, Cohesity, and emerging vendors — many with lower-cost backup offerings. While Rubrik has positioned itself as a premium, AI-native cyber recovery platform, pricing pressure could emerge in mid-market deals or renewals. Any sign of discounting or ASP compression would undercut gross margin confidence. 3. Reliance on Cloud PartnershipsRubrik’s Microsoft and AWS integrations are strengths — but also dependencies. If those partners pivot product strategy, shift co-selling alignment, or prioritize their own tools, Rubrik’s funnel could be disrupted. Partner fatigue or shifting incentives are execution risks not fully priced in. 4. IPO Transition and Reporting ScrutinyAs a newly public company, Rubrik must now meet the rigor of quarterly financial scrutiny. Any inconsistency in disclosure, slippage in RPO, or misalignment between growth and margin could trigger outsized stock reactions. Execution discipline — not just topline growth — will define Rubrik’s post-IPO multiple. Keys to Watch 3:31 pm 1. ARR Growth Trajectory and Large Deal MixWith ~$784M in ARR entering Q1, the Street expects Rubrik to exit FY25 on a ~$1B ARR run-rate. Key to this is continued growth in $1M+ ARR customers and large enterprise wins. Investors will be looking for sequential adds in that cohort, as well as commentary on deal cycles and retention. 2. Microsoft Partnership ActivationRubrik’s GTM alignment with Microsoft — particularly around Azure and Office 365 data protection — is seen as a key differentiator. This quarter, investors want evidence that joint field activity is translating to pipeline conversion, particularly in mid-market and public sector verticals. Deal attribution commentary will be closely parsed. 3. Gross Margin Stability and Product ExpansionLast reported gross margin was 78%, among the highest in SaaS. If this holds or improves, it supports the long-term model of Rubrik as a profitable security platform. Management may offer commentary on adoption of new SKUs — including sensitive data classification and policy automation tools — which could lift ASP and reduce churn. 4. RPO Conversion and Billing PatternsRubrik’s RPO grew 55% YoY last reported, and Q1 is expected to show how much of that is converting to near-term revenue. Investors will track deferred revenue build and renewal velocity to assess whether the business is front-loaded or recurring. Clean billings execution would reinforce ARR confidence. Consensus Estimates 3:30 pm Q1 FY2025 Street Estimates: Revenue: $187.2M (+38% YoY) Adjusted EPS: –$0.33 Gross Margin: ~78% Adj. EBITDA: –$32.4M ARR (prior disclosed): $784M Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO): $811M Growth Metrics to Watch: $1M+ ARR Customers: 117 last reported (+66% YoY) Net Revenue Retention: ~120% Multi-product adoption rate: &gt;50% The Street expects Rubrik to sustain strong revenue momentum into Q2, with guide implications pointing to $200M+ quarterly run-rate before year-end. Analysts are looking for updates to customer count, upsell trends, and vertical-specific traction, particularly in public sector, healthcare, and regulated industries. Cash burn will remain elevated — EBITDA losses are expected near $30M+ — but the focus is on narrowing those losses quarter over quarter while maintaining high ARR expansion and multi-product attach rates. Any progress toward FCF breakeven or improved CAC payback would be viewed as a sign of operational maturity. Rubrik enters its first earnings release as a public company with significant expectations baked into its valuation and narrative. The cybersecurity and data resilience platform is positioned as a high-growth, cloud-native alternative to legacy backup and recovery vendors — and the Street is watching closely to see whether that pitch holds up under public scrutiny. Consensus expects $187.2M in revenue (+38% YoY) and an adjusted EPS loss of –$0.33, sharply improved from –$1.58 YoY. The quarter will test Rubrik’s ability to maintain hypergrowth while narrowing losses and will serve as the first checkpoint for public market investors to evaluate execution quality, GTM leverage, and forward ARR visibility. Management previously disclosed ARR of $784M and 55% YoY growth in RPO. This quarter is expected to show continued traction in large enterprise deals — especially those tied to Microsoft cloud workloads. A key test will be whether customers adopting Rubrik Security Cloud are scaling usage and adding modules such as threat detection, compliance auditing, and ransomware response automation. Given Rubrik’s premium valuation and compressed FCF profile, execution on both growth and efficiency must be crisp. Investors will seek signals that sales productivity is improving, gross margins remain near 78%, and that runway remains long even as growth decelerates modestly from IPO-era acceleration.

You can listen in here if you&#8217;d like. The stock is currently down 3.4%. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that almost every major stock reporting tonight is seeing red after-hours. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign is down 16%, and Rubrik jumped 6% after its earnings were released. However, its shares are now flat. Translation: After a furious two-month stock market rally, investors expectations for what companies should be delivering has risen. If any material news impacts Broadcom&#8217;s share price during its conference call we&#8217;ll post an update. One Standout Figure from Broadcom&#039;s Earnings 4:41 pm by Eric Bleeker One figure to pay attention to is that Broadcom is guiding to AI revenue next quarter of $5.1 billion, that&#8217;s above Wall Street&#8217;s expectations of $4.8 billion. Keep in mind that Broadcom&#8217;s stock has moved significantly in recent quarters based on conference call commentary, so where it&#8217;s trading right now (-2.5%) could be very different than where it opens tomorrow if the company&#8217;s CEO gives some especially bullish comments about future AI demand. It&#039;s a Beat and Raise for Broadcom - So Why Aren&#039;t Shares Moving? 4:37 pm by Joel South Broadcom issued a beat and raise for tonight&#8217;s earnings, not only surpassing last quarter&#8217;s expectations from Wall Street, but also topping guidance. So why aren&#8217;t the share moving north after-hours? Simply put, Broadcom has rallied a remarkable 78% since April 4th, so plenty of optimism was built in headed into these earnings. A slight beat and guide for the coming quarter above consensus is generally expected when stocks have rallied as furiously as Broadcom has in recent months. Make no mistake, Broadcom&#8217;s quarter was solid and its guidance for next quarter points to continuing momentum. However, the results are also not far enough above consensus to move the needle much after Broadcom&#8217;s recent run. Broadcom Shares are Rebounding 4:29 pm by Joel South Broadcom shares are rebounding, now roughly flat after initially dropping several percent after the company&#8217;s earnings release. Shares Slide Despite Record Q2 Results on Surging AI Demand 4:26 pm by Joel South Broadcom posted strong Q2 results, with revenue climbing 20% year-over-year to a record $15 billion, fueled by rapid growth in AI semiconductor demand and contributions from VMware. The company reported GAAP net income of $5 billion and non-GAAP net income of $7.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 35% to $10.0 billion, representing 67% of revenue. AI revenue reached $4.4 billion in Q2, up 46% from the previous year, and is projected to grow further to $5.1 billion in Q3. CEO Hock Tan noted continued investment from hyperscale partners and 10 straight quarters of AI revenue growth. Broadcom also generated $6.4 billion in free cash flow, returning $7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. The company expects Q3 revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and maintains strong profitability guidance. Despite this, shares slipped in after-hour trading 28.6% from the close. Execution Risks 3:33 pm by Joel South Despite strong momentum, Broadcom’s Q2 setup is not without potential downside risks. The most immediate is hyperscaler AI capex cyclicality. While demand remains strong, cloud buildouts can be lumpy, and any signal of Q3 digestion or budget reallocation — especially in networking — could imply slower sequential growth, even if the long-term trajectory remains intact. On the software side, customer churn within VMware remains a meaningful risk. Broadcom’s go-to-market changes — including consolidation of SKUs and tighter bundling — could alienate long-time customers, especially in segments like EUC (End-User Computing) that are being divested or deemphasized. If bookings slow or renewal rates dip below plan, the market may question whether VMware revenue is truly durable. Another issue is regulatory scrutiny and deal pipeline constraints. Broadcom has long relied on M&amp;A to build scale and pricing power. But with global regulators now increasingly aggressive, further transformative acquisitions could face long timelines or outright rejection, limiting long-term inorganic growth potential. Finally, valuation has expanded significantly. The stock trades at ~25x forward EPS — toward the high end of its historical range. That leaves limited room for error on the Q2 results or full-year guide. If margins contract, or if guidance remains unchanged despite tailwinds, the bar may prove too high. Keys to Watch 3:32 pm by Joel South 1. GenAI Ethernet Momentum and ASP Trends:The durability of Broadcom’s AI networking tailwind is the single most important question heading into this release. Investors want to know if demand from hyperscalers is accelerating, stabilizing, or softening — and whether AVGO is gaining share vs. InfiniBand-based alternatives like Nvidia’s Mellanox stack. A beat in networking and bullish comments on demand visibility into 2H FY24 would reinforce Broadcom’s role as a backbone infrastructure supplier for AI training and inference clusters. 2. VMware Margins, Churn, and Booking Signals:While headline growth will be boosted by VMware consolidation, investors care more about how profitable those dollars are. If VMware segment operating margin exceeds 60% or gross margin trends toward the high-70s, the software synergy thesis gains credibility. Watch closely for commentary on customer renewals, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), and any soft patches in product overlap areas. 3. Guidance Lift and Fiscal Discipline:Management has guided conservatively over the past year, often beating internally restrained expectations. If Broadcom raises its full-year revenue outlook to $51B or above and holds EBITDA margin at 60%, it would confirm confidence in both software execution and sustained AI spend. That could justify further multiple expansion in the mid-20x EPS range. Core Results &amp; Segment Highlights 3:31 pm by Joel South Q2 FY2024 Street Estimates: Revenue: $12.04B Adjusted EPS: $10.84 YoY Revenue Growth: +37.6% Adj. Gross Margin (guide): ~75% Adj. EBITDA Margin (guide): 60% FY24 (Implied): Full-Year Revenue Guide (prior): $50B AI Infrastructure Run-Rate (last disclosed): $1B/quarter VMware Contribution Estimate (Q2): ~$2.3B Legacy Semiconductor Core (ex-VMware): ~$9.7B Broadcom has beaten Street EPS estimates in each of the last 12 quarters. Last quarter, it reported EPS of $10.99 on $11.96B in revenue, exceeding guidance on both lines and attributing the strength primarily to AI-related Ethernet demand and an unexpectedly smooth start to VMware integration. This quarter, analysts are expecting flat-to-up sequential trends in networking, mid-single-digit growth in broadband, and mid-teens growth in wireless — all consistent with seasonal patterns. Software is expected to rise sharply YoY due to VMware, but investors will differentiate between organic Broadcom software and new VMware revenue. Most expect VMware to contribute &gt;$2B per quarter with 70–75% gross margin and 55–60% EBITDA margin — if Broadcom delivers higher, that would confirm synergy realization is ahead of pace. Notably, guidance will carry more weight than the headline numbers. Street models are anticipating an update to full-year revenue closer to $51B and potential EBITDA upside if VMware cost actions flow through earlier than planned. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) enters its Q2 FY2024 earnings release as one of the most closely watched semiconductor and infrastructure software plays, sitting squarely at the intersection of two defining technology narratives: hyperscale AI infrastructure deployment and large-scale software consolidation. Expectations are high across the board, and the stock has reflected that enthusiasm — surging over 30% in the past month to all-time highs, with investors pricing in both generative AI upside and a smooth VMware integration path. Analysts are modeling $12.04B in revenue (+37.6% YoY) and $10.84 in adjusted EPS, with roughly $2.3B expected from VMware in its first full quarter post-acquisition. The remainder of the growth is expected to come from AI-enabling components — especially Broadcom’s switch ASICs, custom silicon, and Ethernet fabric interconnects, which are widely deployed by hyperscale customers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The company previously disclosed that GenAI-related sales were running at a $1B quarterly pace — and any update on that figure will be a core focus. Broadcom’s results will serve as a high-stakes litmus test for enterprise AI infrastructure demand, especially given recent mixed signals from peers. Nvidia has flagged broad-based hyperscaler spend, while Marvell noted pushouts. Broadcom’s exposure is deeper in networking, and the expectation is for that segment to grow over 50% YoY, barring any cloud digestion pause. Just as important is the VMware narrative. Management previously guided to 60% EBITDA margins on a combined basis and expressed confidence that early cost synergies would materialize faster than expected. But as VMware customer contracts turn over, the Street wants proof that Broadcom can retain revenue while simplifying the product portfolio. Any sign of subscription churn or integration friction could undercut the broader software platform thesis.

MSFT,2025-06-04 16:10:02,Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/palantir-technologies-nasdaq-pltr-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-20250604.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) gained 5.31% over the past five trading days, bringing its one-month gain to 6.21%. Year-to-date, the stock is up an eye-catching 74.53%, and over the past year, it has gained an absurd 495%. While the stock&#8217;s forward P/E ratio — currently 238.10 — can be concerning, Palantir&#8217;s federal contracts and aerospace ties are expected to continue fueling growth. While earnings are rear-facing, the emerging trends seen in the company&#8217;s Q1 results can serve as a foundation for further rewards for shareholders. In the first quarter, Palantir saw year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. U.S. commercial business surpassed a $1 billion run rate, good for 71% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year. PLTR&#8217;s market multiple implies it could take an investor nearly half a century to recover their initial investment, assuming earnings remained constant. But the assumption from the company — and from Wall Street analysts — is that earnings will continue to grow. EPS in Q1 2024, for example, stood at 8 cents, while EPS in Q1 2025 rose to 13 cents, good for an increase of 62.5%. So while there is concern about its valuation, what can investors expect from Palantir over the next year? 24/7 Wall St. did some analysis, so let’s take a look at. Key Points in This Article: Palantir&#8217;s government line of business accounts for more than half of its revenue, with existing contracts between the AI firm and the U.S. Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Agriculture, the FBI, the CDC, the U.S. Army and the UK&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, to name a handful. The company&#8217;s explosive commercial revenue growth shows that it is capable of sustainably scaling without being overly reliant upon federal contracts. It also provides services to numerous industries, including energy, data protection, health and life sciences, insurance, hospital operations, retail, semiconductors, telecommunications and utilities, among others.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Palantir? The AI environment is ripe for growth, though, of which Palantir should play a major part. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $1.811 trillion by the end of the decade, good for a 35.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2025 and 2030. The global market size of AI in 2024 was $279.2 billion, meaning at that forecasted CAGR, by the end of 2025, the market should expand to $379.4 billion. Companies like Palantir that focus on broad AI applications in diverse industries should see the lion&#8217;s share of that growth. This industry growth potential is one reason Palantir provided strong guidance in its Q1 earnings call, stating that it expects 36% revenue growth, with free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Not only has the company seen sizable growth, it forecasts sustainable momentum that will help continue that pattern over the course of the next year. Palantir’s government segment, which contributes 55% of revenue, grew 45% year-over-year in Q1 2025 to $373 million. High-profile contracts, like the recently signed ICE deal and NATO’s adoption of its AI-enabled military system, highlight its critical role in national security. President Trump&#8217;s emphasis on defense and government efficiency, exemplified by the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, positions Palantir as a go-to AI software provider, boosting investor confidence amid tariff-related market challenges. Additionally, the company&#8217;s commercial segment has skyrocketed, with U.S. commercial revenue up 71% year-over-year to $255 million in Q1 2025. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, empowers enterprises in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing to harness AI for data analytics. Strategic partnerships and 139 deals worth $1 million or more in Q1 (31 were over $10 million) demonstrate Palantir’s private-sector expansion, helping to drive stock gains. Palantir’s focus on operational efficiency has improved profitability, with adjusted operating margins expanding to 36% in Q1 2025 from 29% in 2024. Its software-as-a-service model, with high-margin recurring revenue, supports scalability across government and commercial clients. The company’s ability to deploy AIP rapidly, as shown by a 69% increase in customer count to 593, enhances revenue predictability. This profitability, coupled with $3.9 billion in cash reserves, fuels R&amp;D and market expansion, reinforcing investor optimism. Palantir (PLTR) as a Stock Since its IPO, Palantir has seen uncommon and exponential share appreciation, rising more than 1,300% since going public on Oct. 2, 2020. An enormous part of that growth came between February 2023 and February 2025, before the market began to correct this year. After reaching its all-time-high on Feb. 18, shares of PLTR fell by more than 40% before bottoming on April 4. But for patient, buy-and-hold investors, they have already been rewarded as the stock has pushed back up and established new all-time highs. Following the company&#8217;s Q1 earnings report, Royal Bank of Canada and Deutsche Bank reiterated their &#8220;Underperform&#8221; and &#8220;Sell&#8221; ratings, respectively, on the AI data analytics firm. Most other analysts, though, maintained their &#8220;Hold&#8221; ratings. A notable exception was Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a PLTR perma-bull who reiterated his buy call, saying Plantar is&#8221;one of our top tech names to own&#8221; and setting a $140 per share price target. Broadly, 18 Wall Street analysts assign the stock a consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating, with three analysts giving it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 11 giving it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and four giving it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. However, price targets for the AI darling represent a vast spread of opinions, with the high-end price target at $140, the median price target at $100.13 and the low-end price target at $40. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $40 -69.69% Median $1o0.13 -24.12% High $150 13.66% Palantir Technologies 2025 Outlook Palantir has made several important announcements over the past few weeks, including a $30 million contract with ICE to develop a system to help with deportations, and a partnership with TWG Global and xAI to bring AI to the financial services industry. That news has driven the stock higher in the short term. But as the broad market&#8217;s outlook remains clouded, so too does Palantir&#8217;s. That is reflected in Wall Street&#8217;s consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. The coming year for Palantir&#8217;s stock performance will continue to be shaped by the contracts it wins, both with the government and the private sector. Analysts project a 35% increase in revenue to $3.88 billion this year, though PLTR raised its guidance to $3.89 billion to $3.9 billion, up from its prior forecast of $3.74 billion to $3.75 billion. Palantir calls for a minimum 68% jump in commercial revenue to $1.178 billion, with CEO Alex Karp saying, &#8220;We are delivering the operating system for the modern enterprise in the era of AI.&#8221; While Palantir does face competition from both large AI Big Data forms, as well as smaller, fast-growing AI data analytics shops, the company can be seen as having an entrenched position within government and large enterprises. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Palantir Technologies is less bearish at $107, which represents 18.92% potential downside from the stock&#8217;s current price. Those figures are based on Palantir having developed the premier AI software, but the decreasing cost of AI and expansion of large language models to lower barriers to entrance in decision-making software. We see projected revenue growth rates moderating over time climb from $3.9 billion in 2025 to $11.9 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $0.58 in 2025 to $1.44 in 2030.

Wall Street Improves Market Outlook 9:51 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 nearly in the rearview mirror, Wall Street analysts are coming out in droves to revise their year-end forecasts. Most recently, Barclays has updated its S&amp;P 500 year-end outlook by close to 3% to 6,050 compared with a previous target of below 6,000. In addition to Barclays, other analysts firms that have lifted their 2025 S&amp;P 500 targets of late include Deutsche Bank and RBC. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets appear to be shrugging off some lackluster labor market data, with all three of the major stock market averages higher as of early morning trading. Yesterday, the markets managed to turn things around, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tacking on its fourth-straight winning session while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 also gained ground. Today, most sectors of the economy are higher, led by technology with a 1.48% advance. Nvidia&#8217;s (Nasdaq: NVDA) muscled Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) out of the way to reclaim the top of the most valuable company in the world rankings, with a market capitalization of $3.45 trillion. Traders are debating whether NVDA stock will see new highs in the near future. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 62.83 (+0.22%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 50.28 (+0.26%) S&amp;P 500: Up 14.10 (+0.24%) Economic Headwinds Private sector hiring lost momentum in May, with payrolls expanding by a mere 37,000 jobs. Results fell short of April&#8217;s 60,000 gain and also missed the Dow Jones forecast of 110,000 by a wide margin.

MSFT,2025-06-04 16:10:02,S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) Live: Markets Show Resilience in Face of Sputtering Economy,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/sp-500-nysearca-spy-live-markets-show-resilience-in-20250604.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Apple in Crosshairs 2:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock has a target on its back. Wall Street firm Needham has downgraded shares of the Big Tech stock to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; arguing the stock is hovering at frothy levels. Needham also pulled its $225 price target, noting a $170-$180 range would be an acceptable entry point. Apple shares were largely unchanged today, while the SPY ETF is up 0.26%. Citi Takes Aim at CEG 11:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analyst firm Citi has reduced its rating on Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG) shares in response to the utility&#8217;s long-term power agreement with Mag 7 stock Meta (Nasdaq: META). Analysts at Citi now classify CEG stock as high-risk, arguing that the company will forgo the opportunity for premium pricing on its nuclear-generated electricity. They have set a price target of $318. CEG shares are falling 3% today after yesterday&#8217;s rock-star performance. The SPY ETF is up 0.16% as of mid-morning trading. S&amp;P Outlook Looking Up 10:05 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 almost behind us, Wall Street analysts are actively revising their year-end market forecasts. Most recently, Barclays has adjusted its S&amp;P 500 year-end outlook upward by nearly 3% to 6,050, a notable increase from its previous target of 5,900. Beyond Barclays, other prominent analyst firms like Deutsche Bank and RBC have also recently elevated their 2025 S&amp;P 500 targets, signaling a positively shifting consensus for the broader market&#8217;s direction. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Market optimism is overriding underwhelming labor market data, with all three major stock averages climbing higher as of morning trading. Yesterday, equities staged a turnaround, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its fourth consecutive winning session, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 also advanced. Today, most economic sectors are in positive territory, with technology leading the charge with a 1.48% gain. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is up 0.11%) Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) has surpassed Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) to reclaim its position as the world&#8217;s most valuable company, now boasting a market capitalization of $3.45 trillion. Traders and investors are betting whether NVDA stock can clinch new highs soon. Private Payrolls Slow, Sparking Rate Cut Calls Private sector hiring lost significant momentum in May, with payrolls expanding by a mere 37,000 jobs. These results not only fell short of April&#8217;s 60,000 gain but also missed the Dow Jones forecast of 110,000 by a wide margin. In a sobering sign for the labor market, it marked the lowest monthly job creation from the ADP report in over two years. Meanwhile, the picture for wages remained largely static compared with the prior month&#8217;s results. Following this weaker-than-expected private sector jobs data, President Trump is increasing pressure on Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, asserting that the Fed chairman should have already taken this action. Discount Retailers Rally, ON Semi Recovers Dollar General (NYSE: DG) is racing ahead by 15.8% today, extending yesterday&#8217;s gains on the back of a positive full-year outlook. Fellow discount retailer Dollar Tree (NYSE: DLTR) is also gaining 6% today, buoyed by similarly upbeat guidance. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is climbing 2.7% today, recouping some recently lost ground. This comes after Morgan Stanley analysts recently indicated that much of the negative sentiment is already factored into ON&#8217;s stock price.

Constellation Energy (CEG) shares are surging in early trading Tuesday after the company said it had struck a 20-year deal to sell nuclear power to Meta Platforms (META), in the latest tech firm-to-nuclear collaboration aimed at powering data centers. Meta will buy the power generation of a Constellation nuclear plant in Clinton, Ill., to power its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions. The financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Starting in June 2027, ""the agreement supports the relicensing and continued operations of Constellation’s high-performing Clinton nuclear facility for another two decades after the state’s ratepayer funded zero emission credit (ZEC) program expires,"" Constellation said. ""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,"" Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said of the deal. Tuesday’s deal between Constellation and Meta is giving nuclear stocks a fresh lift as the Instagram and Facebook owner joins tech rivals from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google to Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services in pouring millions of dollars to boost their nuclear power access for AI. This deal builds on earlier efforts by Constellation, which said last year it would be restarting Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide electricity for Microsoft’s data centers in a 20-year supply deal. More recently, executive orders signed by President Donald Trump last month to accelerate the approval of new reactors and strengthen fuel supply chains have also buoyed nuclear power stocks. Shares in Constellation, which are jumping 10% in early trading, have gained 40% so far this year entering Tuesday. NuScale Power (SMR), Oklo (OKLO), Vistra (VST) and Centrus Energy (LEU) are all up at least 3% in early trading Tuesday. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Meanwhile, JPMorgan has expanded its list of top stocks, coinciding with the final month of trading for H1 2025. The analyst firm has reportedly turned more bullish on Take-Two Interactive (Nasdaq: TTWO) and Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX), joining a cohort that also includes McDonald&#8217;s (NYSE: MCD) and Boeing (NYSE: BA). Market Movers 1:01 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Steel Dynamics (Nasdaq: STLD) is out front with a 9.5% gain. Fellow steelmaker Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is rising close to 9% on the steel tariff development. Newmont (NYSE: NEM) is tacking on 6% as the gold price soars and investors run for shelter. GM (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F) are lower by 4% and 3%, respectively, as steel import tariffs come into focus. The SPY ETF is currently higher by 0.11%. Factory Sector Slowdown 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. manufacturing activity continued its deceleration in May, marking the third consecutive month of contraction. The Manufacturing PMI registered 48.5%, a slight dip from 48.7% in April. This index, which reflects the health of both the manufacturing and services sectors, signals ongoing weakness. Not surprisingly, the imports segment plunged to its lowest level in almost two decades. Against this backdrop of slowing economic indicators, stocks remain under pressure, including a 1.2% decline in Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW). Conversely, the price of gold is surging, up 2.5% to exceed $3,400 per ounce, as investors increasingly seek a safe haven amidst growing signs of an economic slowdown. The SPY ETF is down 0.08%. S&amp;P 500 Hunts Bottom 10:12 am by Gerelyn Terzo As the first half of 2025 nears the end, some Wall Street analysts are revising their S&amp;P 500 targets. Most recently, RBC analysts have increased their year-end S&amp;P 500 target to 5,730, up from 5,550. However, the prediction, made by RBC&#8217;s Lori Calvasina, suggests the broader market index has another 3% to fall based on last week&#8217;s closing level. The SPY index remains under pressure and is currently lower by 0.42%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are starting off the month of June under pressure. Technology stocks have reversed earlier gains, leaving all three of the major stock market averages lower as of mid-morning trading, including the S&amp;P 500. The overwhelming sentiment among traders and investors is one of tariff-war uncertainty amid rising tensions between the White House and China over a previously reached short-term tariff agreement. In response, stocks are lower and while Treasury yields are being pushed higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield experiencing a 2-basis-point bump to 4.4%. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is currently down 0.60%. Despite the tariff uncertainty, the markets quietly moved higher last month. May witnessed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advance over 9%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed higher by 6% and 4%, respectively. Technology stocks fueled much of the gains, led by Big Tech leaders such as Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT). Market Movers Steel stocks are bucking the downward trend in today&#8217;s markets. The Trump administration announced a doubling of tariffs on steel imports to 50%, a move directly benefiting U.S. steelmakers. Today, Cleveland-Cliffs is soaring over 22%, Steel Dynamics (Nasdaq: STLD) is up 13.4%, and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) has climbed 11.7%. This sector-wide rally is providing a strong lift to the VanEck Steel ETF, which is up 3% today. Turning to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, analysts predict that Dow component Boeing (NYSE: BA) could ride some tariff-related tailwinds. Bank of America has upgraded BA shares to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a revised price target of $260, a notable jump from its previous $185. BofA analysts suggest the White House may strategically leverage Boeing&#8217;s jetliners as a key negotiating asset in upcoming trade discussions. As a result, BA stock is currently gaining 1.7% The post S&#038;P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) Live: Markets Kick Off June in the Doldrums After China Trade Tensions Resurface appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/sp-500-nysearca-spy-live-markets-kick-off-june-in-the-doldrums-after-china-trade-tensions-resurface/

The investment will go towards upgrading and expanding its four existing data centres near Geneva and Zurich, allowing Microsoft to meet growing demand for AI services while keeping data within Swiss borders, a key priority for clients in finance, healthcare and the public sector. The announcement came during a meeting in Bern between Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin and Microsoft vice chair Brad Smith. While job creation figures were not disclosed, the company said the move would support existing and new customers, as well as partnerships with smaller businesses. Microsoft also plans to expand training efforts to help more people adopt AI and digital tools. Smith praised Switzerland’s research and innovation ecosystem, calling it a global leader in combining science with practical application. Excellon Resources Inc (TSX:EXN, OTCQB:EXNRF) has secured up to $7.5 million from Glencore through a strategic streaming and offtake agreement, enabling the restart of its Mallay silver-lead-zinc mine in Peru by early 2026. This deal, along with a $10.5 million financing round—featuring increased investment from Eric Sprott—brings total project funding to $18 million. CEO Shawn Howarth confirmed that Glencore will act as the dedicated buyer of Mallay’s concentrate, ensuring a direct path to market. Excellon is also advancing work at its Tres Cerros and Kilgore projects. Proactive: Can you give us an update on Excellon's Mallay project? Shawn Howarth: We’ve signed a definitive agreement with Glencore for up to $7.5 million in liquidity support. This will help restart the Mallay mine in Peru by early 2026. It's a former producer with excellent infrastructure, and we’re targeting near-surface areas with remaining mineralization. What are the terms of the Glencore deal? It’s a streaming and offtake agreement. Glencore will provide funding in exchange for future silver, lead, and zinc concentrate from Mallay. Importantly, they’ll also serve as the dedicated buyer—streamlining our route to market. What’s the next step at Mallay? We plan to start a three- to five-month underground rehab program, giving us better access to the deposit. Following that, we’ll conduct drilling to improve our understanding of near-term production zones and explore the broader system. How does the $18M total financing break down? Along with Glencore’s $7.5 million, we raised $10.5 million in a concurrent offering. Notably, Eric Sprott increased his stake, which is a strong vote of confidence. Any updates on your other assets? Yes, we’re moving forward at Tres Cerros and the Kilgore gold project in Idaho. But for now, our priority is safely and quickly bringing Mallay back online.

MSFT,2025-05-28 14:06:21,Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/amazon-nasdaq-amzn-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-20250528.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost 2.29% over the past five trading sessions, halting a rally that has seen the stock gain 23.16% since its year-to-date low of $167.32 on April 21. On the year, the e-commerce giant has seen its stock lose 6.42% despite beating on EPS and revenue by 16.77% and 0.35%, respectively, in Q1. Tempered forward guidance due to President Trump&#8217;s tariffs continues to cloud Amazon&#8217;s outlook. However, with the U.S. and China agreeing to a 90-day reduction in tariffs on May 11, there is renewed hope for the consumer discretionary mainstay, who has seen its one-year gain diminished to 12.28%. In its recent earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% in 2025, with its one-year gain having been erased in Q1, which now stands at a 0.79% loss. In early April, Piper Sandler lowered its price target for Amazon to $215 from $265; however, the firm maintained its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating saying it is looking for Q1 revenue of $153B and within the $151B–$155B guidance range. Piper forecasts AWS growth of 17% year-over-year. For Q2, the firm anticipates a guidance range of $157B–$162B and op income guidance of $14B–$18B. Piper lowered its 2025 ads revenue growth by about 1% and online stores and 3P services. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. Key Points in This Article: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has sunk 15.15%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; $240.62 consensus price target is just shy of Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 48 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 64.01% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,927 position increases versus 2,426 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -5.02% Median $240.62 17.19% High $305.00 48.55% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumers appear to be pulling back on spending due to ongoing inflation, contracting GDP in Q1 and the possibility of a recession in 2025. Over the past month, however, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed admirably, posting a gain of 18.14%, second only to tech&#8217;s gain of 21.31% over the same period. That rebound represents a stark difference from the sector&#8217;s last-place performance among the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 11 sectors through Q1 2025. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

For bearish-leaning risk takers, the SPXS ETF offers powerful leverage when the S&amp;P 500 declines. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) The first quarter of this year reminded optimistic investors that stocks don&#8217;t only go up. Trade war tensions, recession worries, and other factors could spur a market crash in 2025. Instead of using fancy strategies like short-selling stocks or buying put options, there&#8217;s an easier way that doesn&#8217;t require a margin account. Bearish-leaning investors can profit from a stock market crash of 20% or more by owning inverse exchange traded funds (ETFs). These funds are specifically designed to gain value when a stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, goes down. There are risks involved, to be sure, but the following three inverse ETFs could set you up for powerful returns if the market craters. ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (SH) The S&amp;P 500 is a commonly cited stock index that represents a broad selection of large-cap U.S.-focused companies. Therefore, a simple way to profit from a stock market crash would be to hold an inverse ETF that gains value when the S&amp;P 500 collapses. ProShares offers an ETF that serves this exact purpose. It&#8217;s a fund called the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SH), and it seeks to move inversely to the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500. What&#8217;s good about moving inversely to the S&amp;P 500 is that it&#8217;s usually a slower-moving index than the NASDAQ 100. Therefore, the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF should carry less risk than some other inverse ETFs. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 comprises a broad range of stocks from multiple market sectors. Some S&amp;P 500 component stocks include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Thus, you&#8217;re actually achieving what I call &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the SH ETF. Even with the somewhat de-risking effect of &#8220;inverse diversification,&#8221; the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF could gain value quickly if there&#8217;s a stock market crash. Be aware, though, that the SH ETF won&#8217;t necessarily move up at the exact same pace that the S&amp;P 500 goes down. That&#8217;s because the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 throughout the day but then resets and rebalances the next day. As ProShares explains, &#8220;For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target [i.e., the S&amp;P 500]. These differences may be significant.&#8221; To put it another way, you&#8217;ll get faithful inverse S&amp;P 500 tracking for a day with the SH ETF. However, the longer you hold the fund, the more the results can vary from what you might expect. Consequently, while the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF would probably make you money during a market crash, it&#8217;s not meant to be held for too long. ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) If you&#8217;re willing to accept more risk, consider that the NASDAQ 100 mostly covers only one market sector (technology) and only includes around 100 stocks (as opposed to around 500 stocks in the more diversified S&amp;P 500). So, an ETF that inversely tracks the NASDAQ 100 is somewhat riskier but could yield greater rewards in the event of a market crash. To that end, you might consider the ProShares Short QQQ ETF (NYSEARCA:PSQ). This fund inversely corresponds to the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 index. Bear in mind that the NASDAQ 100 is mainly focused on technology sector stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). You won&#8217;t get as much &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the ProShares Short QQQ ETF as you would get with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, but you could potentially achieve greater returns during a market crash with the PSQ ETF. Much like with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, the ProShares Short QQQ ETF is subject to unexpected results if you hold the fund for longer than a day. Hence, I&#8217;ll send out a similar warning: even if the stock market is collapsing, don&#8217;t hold the PSQ ETF for too long because the risks will probably increase over time. Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (SPXS) My third entry for the best inverse ETFs to profit in a market crash is the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXS). This, like the SH ETF, may be somewhat de-risked because it inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 and has &#8220;inverse diversification.&#8221; However, the SPXS ETF is still the riskiest fund on this list. What makes the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF so high-risk and potentially high-reward is that the fund is inverse and triple-leveraged. This means that the SPXS ETF, on a daily basis, moves three times as fast as the S&amp;P 500, but in the opposite direction. In theory, you might assume that the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF would go up 60% if the S&amp;P 500 goes down 20%. Again, however, there&#8217;s no assurance of faithful index tracking beyond one day. Hence, you could get highly unexpected results if you hold the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF for a long time. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s probably too risky to hold the SPXS ETF for more than a couple of weeks, even during a stock market crash. Besides, if the stock market suddenly rallies, the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF could make a triple-magnified move to the downside. The point is that the SPXS ETF is for nimble, sniper-like traders who can get into and out of a position quickly. If you prefer to take on less risk, consider the non-leveraged ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF or ProShares Short QQQ ETF.The post 3 Best Inverse ETFs to Profit in a Market Crash appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/05/22/3-best-inverse-etfs-to-profit-in-a-market-crash/

It edged out Microsoft, Toyota, Costco, and others. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The study&#8217;s methodology involved three waves of surveys. The first asked consumers to rank the best and worst companies. The second survey determined the 100 companies. The third asked about “contextual” issues, including opinions about brands and topics, including politics. These were in the field from January through mid-May. Following Trader Joe’s on the list were clothing company Patagonia, Microsoft, Toyota, and retail giant Costco. Trader Joe’s rose 12 spots from last year’s list. Trader Joe’s seems to have a cult following. It targets building local communities through grants to nonprofits, along with food and beverage donations, Trader Joe’s is known among its customers for an unusual level of transparency. This has to do with food prices, why some items are discontinued, and why prices differ from location to location. It also rarely sells products that carry another company’s brands Trader Joe’s also has several unique methods used to target customers. Its traditional direct marketing includes newsletters. Content in what it calls The Fearless Flyer is based on anecdotes and stories about products it sells. The theory behind it appears to be that it cements its relationship with shoppers. The company uses podcasts and recipes for similar reasons. Axios Harris Poll 100 produces non-traditional results. Trader Joe’s and Patagonia are niche companies. Microsoft, Toyota, and Costco are among the largest companies that do business in the United States, as well as among America’s most well-known brands. It also lists J.C. Penney, a company that is essentially out of business. Despite the quirks of the list, who would not want to finish first?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is sinking by over 300 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are losing about 0.55% apiece. Google parent company Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is a bright spot, rising 1.8% today.

MSFT,2025-05-22 16:40:30,Zoom (ZM) Quarterly Earnings Live Coverage,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/zoom-zm-quarterly-earnings-live-coverage-20250522.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Earnings beat 4:21 pm EPS: $1.43 actual vs. $1.31 estimate → +9.2% beat Revenue: $1.175B actual vs. $1.17B estimate → +0.4% beat Earnings Beat with Strong Margins, But Growth Remains Tame 4:09 pm Zoom reported Q1 FY26 revenue of $1.175 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year, with non-GAAP EPS of $1.43, beating the Street’s $1.31 estimate by 9%. GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, a 19% YoY improvement. Enterprise revenue rose 5.9% to $705 million, while Online revenue dipped 1.2% to $470 million — consistent with the ongoing shift toward larger, more durable contracts. Operating margins were strong across the board: GAAP operating margin hit 20.6%, while non-GAAP operating margin reached 39.8%. Customer momentum was solid, with 4,192 customers now contributing over $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue, up 8% YoY. However, net dollar expansion for enterprise accounts slipped to 98%, suggesting slower upsell activity. Zoom repurchased 5.6 million shares and ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in cash. Free cash flow was $463 million, down YoY, but still healthy. Guidance was slightly above expectations: Q2 revenue is projected at $1.195–$1.200 billion with EPS of $1.36–$1.37. FY26 revenue is guided to $4.80–$4.81 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $5.56–$5.59 — modestly higher than previous estimates. Past earnings reactions 3:44 pm Zoom’s earnings have been a model of consistency, but that consistency has done little to lift the stock. All four most recent quarters featured solid EPS beats — yet post-earnings movement has been largely neutral. To break this pattern, Zoom will need to show a shift in narrative: enterprise expansion, monetization of AI tools, or improving RPO. Absent that, even another beat may leave the stock treading water. Quarter EPS Actual EPS Est. Surprise Stock Reaction Q4 FY25 $1.41 $1.35 +5% Flat Q3 FY25 $1.38 $1.31 +6% Flat/–2% Q2 FY25 $1.39 $1.22 +14% Flat Q1 FY25 $1.35 $1.19 +13% Flat Zoom stock sentiment 3:33 pm Zoom’s short interest remains relatively low — around 2.2% of float — but options markets suggest growing skepticism into earnings. There has been notable put activity around the $75–$80 range, indicating some downside protection among long holders. The stock has traded in a tight band for months, and with little movement on strong EPS beats, traders appear to be bracing for a “good but not good enough” outcome. Analyst sentiment is neutral-to-cautious, and several firms have trimmed price targets in recent months without downgrading. The key setup: if Zoom misses or guides weak, there’s room for downside. But if it delivers upside and hints at AI revenue traction, low short interest could limit the intensity of any selloff. Steady Execution 2:37 pm Zoom’s last earnings call was all about balance: management emphasized durable enterprise growth while acknowledging ongoing pressure in the online/SMB segment. CEO Eric Yuan spoke at length about Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center as long-term growth engines, but didn’t provide revenue breakouts or attach metrics for either. The tone was calm, consistent, and arguably too cautious. Analysts pressed the company for clarity on AI monetization through its Zoom AI Companion rollout, but received only directional answers. CFO Kelly Steckelberg reaffirmed guidance but flagged slower renewals in EMEA and higher competition in the public sector. This quarter, Zoom needs to show that AI tools aren’t just a product enhancement but a revenue driver. Investors also want more segmentation of growth — especially between the enterprise and online business lines. What to watch this quarter: Revenue contribution or attach rate updates from AI tools Net expansion trends across enterprise accounts Specific metrics around Zoom Phone/Contact Center growth Any signal of stabilization in churned regions AI Tools and Enterprise Momentum Must Start Driving Numbers 1:28 pm Zoom’s product roadmap continues to evolve, with the company pushing hard into AI-driven enhancements through its AI Companion tools, as well as deeper investments in Contact Center and Zoom Phone. But these offerings have yet to move the needle meaningfully on top-line growth. On last quarter’s call, management flagged strong enterprise adoption but admitted that online customer churn remained a drag. Gross margin was stable above 78%, but free cash flow dipped, and revenue growth slowed to just 2% YoY. This quarter, investors want to see if enterprise net expansion is holding and whether AI products are leading to measurable upsell. Any shift in RPO trajectory or commentary on upsell momentum will be closely dissected. Watch for: Growth in Zoom Phone or Contact Center revenue RPO and deferred revenue trends AI Companion monetization signals Margin stability and cash flow commentary Earnings Must Clarify Whether Growth Has Truly Bottomed 12:28 pm Zoom’s macro challenge is no secret — the pandemic boom is long over, and the company now competes in a price-sensitive, saturated UCaaS market. While management has leaned into new verticals like Zoom Phone and AI Companion tools, those segments remain too small to drive top-line acceleration on their own. The last four earnings reports have all beaten EPS expectations, yet the stock reaction has been minimal. Why? Because Zoom hasn’t been able to show a compelling growth reacceleration or defend market share against bundled platforms like Microsoft Teams. Heading into this print, investors will want updates on enterprise net retention, contribution from Contact Center, and whether AI features are leading to actual monetization. Flat or declining RPO could signal continued stagnation — while even a modest uptick might spark renewed interest if paired with margin stability. Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) reports earnings after the market closes today, with Wall Street looking for signs of steady enterprise traction in what’s become an increasingly saturated unified communications market. The company is expected to post EPS of $1.31 on $1.17 billion in revenue — both modestly lower than year-ago levels and roughly in line with recent trends. The broader setup: low expectations, high execution consistency, and a stock that’s moved mostly sideways in 2025. Over the past year, Zoom has quietly posted four consecutive earnings beats, but those surprises haven’t sparked meaningful stock upside. That reflects investor skepticism that core revenue streams — especially the legacy online video product — can drive meaningful growth without significant margin trade-offs. While management has pushed into new verticals like Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center, adoption rates remain slow, and pricing pressure continues to weigh on visibility. One area that could shift sentiment is AI. The company has touted AI Companion and other intelligent collaboration features, but these haven’t yet generated material monetization. That puts extra pressure on today’s earnings call to clarify go-to-market traction and attach rates for AI-enhanced services. Zoom’s full-year FY26 EPS is forecast at $5.37, slightly below last year’s $5.54, which tells the story: this is a stable, cash-generating company still trying to find its next growth gear. With competitors like Microsoft Teams bundling aggressively, and RingCentral and Cisco investing in UCaaS integrations, Zoom’s positioning is increasingly a margin defense game — not a top-line expansion story. Analysts will be focused on enterprise churn rates, gross margin mix, and any acceleration in RPO as potential green shoots. After several quarters of holding steady, the question for Zoom isn’t “will they deliver?” — it’s whether delivering is enough.

MSFT,2025-05-22 11:09:08,Snowflake (SNOW) 1st Quarter Earnings Live Coverage,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/snowflake-snow-1st-quarter-earnings-live-coverage-20250522.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Quick Recap 4:20 pm EPS (Non-GAAP): Not disclosed in the release — awaiting transcript or call.(The pre-release guidance implied ~$0.22–$0.23. Likely in line or modest beat) Product Revenue: $996.8M actual vs. $1.01B estimate → ~1.3% miss Total Revenue: $1.04B actual vs. $1.02–$1.03B consensus range → Slight beat Note: SNOW’s after-hours +5.6% move suggests Street was bracing for a softer print; RPO strength offset revenue miss. Up 5.6% After Hours — Execution Beat Clears the Bar, For Now 4:16 pm Snowflake shares rose 5.6% after hours following its Q1 print, signaling that the market was bracing for worse and found the steady revenue growth and robust RPO more than enough to offset deepening losses. While profitability remains a drag, the strong customer expansion and $6.7B in RPO validated the demand story — especially with enterprise software sentiment still fragile across the board. This price action suggests investors were more concerned about a usage slowdown or a reset in long-term guidance — neither of which materialized. The 606 million-dollar customers and continued momentum in AI narrative positioning helped reinforce Snowflake’s status as a durable platform name with optionality, even if monetization of next-gen features like Cortex and Snowpark is still emerging. That said, this reaction also likely reflects relief more than re-rating. For Snowflake to reclaim its high-multiple valuation and push beyond the $190–$200 zone, investors will eventually need more than just growth. Margin progress or explicit AI revenue metrics would be the likely fuel for a true breakout — but tonight, it’s clear the bar was set low enough for a beat to rally the stock. Snowflake Delivers $997M in Product Revenue but Posts Wider Loss 4:13 pm Snowflake’s fiscal Q1 2026 results came in largely aligned with investor expectations on the top line, but profitability remains a sticking point. Product revenue rose 26% year-over-year to $996.8 million, meeting guidance and extending the company’s streak of solid double-digit growth. Total revenue hit $1.04 billion, a new quarterly record. Remaining performance obligations grew 34% to $6.7 billion, suggesting healthy forward demand. Despite the top-line strength, Snowflake posted a GAAP net loss of $430 million, or $1.29 per share, a significantly wider loss than the same quarter last year. Operating expenses climbed over 25%, with sales and marketing costs topping $458 million and R&amp;D reaching $472 million. Adjusted free cash flow also shrank year-over-year to $206.3 million, reflecting heavier investment in operations and headcount amid platform expansion. The AI Data Cloud strategy was again front and center. Snowflake now serves 606 customers generating more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue, up 27% YoY. But profitability remains elusive as the company continues to prioritize infrastructure scale and product build-out over margin. Past earnings reactions 3:43 pm Snowflake has topped EPS estimates in three of the last four quarters, but price reactions have been muted — with the exception of the Q1 FY25 miss, which triggered a sharp selloff. The pattern is clear: beats don’t drive the stock unless accompanied by upside in usage metrics like RPO or product revenue. For tonight, merely hitting numbers may not be enough. Investors will be listening closely for evidence of traction in AI-native features and signs that larger enterprise customers are expanding usage across Snowflake’s platform. Quarter EPS Actual EPS Est. Surprise Stock Reaction Q4 FY25 $0.30 $0.17 +76% +4% Q3 FY25 $0.20 $0.15 +33% Flat Q2 FY25 $0.18 $0.16 +13% Flat/–1% Q1 FY25 $0.14 $0.18 –21% –12% Snowflake stock sentiment 3:32 pm Investor sentiment on Snowflake remains split. Institutional ownership remains high, but options activity ahead of earnings has leaned bullish, with elevated call volume near the $190 and $200 strikes. Despite the stock’s strong year-to-date performance, short interest is modest — under 3% of float — suggesting limited outright bearish conviction. However, many large funds have taken a wait-and-see stance following Snowflake’s stock-based comp controversy and uneven quarterly billings trends. Sell-side analysts are cautiously optimistic, with most ratings clustered in the Buy-to-Hold range and a median target around $203 — only modestly above current levels. Earnings-day volatility is typically elevated for SNOW, with options pricing implying a post-print move of ~7–9%. A strong RPO or AI monetization update could push shares through recent resistance, while muted platform usage data could invite a reset. AI Story Is Clear, Monetization Path Still Isn’t 2:37 pm On the last call, Snowflake executives leaned hard into the AI Data Cloud narrative. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy highlighted Cortex, Snowpark Container Services, and partnerships with Nvidia as cornerstones of Snowflake’s long-term roadmap. The company repeatedly emphasized that generative AI workloads would become a major source of data growth — and that Snowflake is positioned to be the “governed data layer” for those deployments. But investors came away with more vision than numbers. There was no quantification of AI’s contribution to RPO or ARR, and management offered little detail on attach rates for Snowpark or Cortex. Another focus was operational discipline. CFO Mike Scarpelli emphasized cost control and headcount restraint as drivers of recent EPS strength, while acknowledging that stock-based compensation remains elevated. With share-based comp still at over 40% of revenue, Snowflake’s narrative needs to transition from visionary to operationally credible. What to watch this quarter: Updated commentary on AI feature usage and client interest Any revenue disclosure tied to Cortex or Snowpark Signals on NRR or multi-product adoption Tone shift from visionary to accountable execution Keys to watch 1:28 pm In recent quarters, Snowflake has delivered impressive headline beats but raised concerns under the surface — particularly around deal timing and monetization of new AI products. While Q4 FY25 posted a strong $0.30 EPS vs. $0.17 estimate, much of the beat was driven by expense control rather than accelerating usage. The company has emphasized its AI Data Cloud vision and the rollout of Snowflake Cortex — a generative AI suite embedded in the platform — but has not disclosed revenue contribution from these new services. Analysts will be pressing for any update on attach rates or NRR improvements tied to AI features. Another key trend is stock-based compensation. SBC accounted for 41% of revenue last year, drawing scrutiny from institutional investors. Any moderation here — especially as revenue scales — could boost confidence in the path to GAAP profitability. Watch for: RPO growth (billings proxy) AI-related platform adoption commentary SBC as % of revenue New customer count and expansion rates Data Cloud Macro Tailwinds Must Now Show Up in Usage and Margins 12:27 pm Snowflake operates in a sweet spot of enterprise software — a data infrastructure layer increasingly central to AI deployment. But that macro opportunity has yet to fully translate into breakout earnings power. With usage-based revenue still sensitive to customer optimization cycles, investors are looking for signals that the stabilization seen across AWS and Azure is flowing into Snowflake’s billings and RPO. Last quarter’s beat was strong on paper — $0.30 EPS vs. $0.17 expected — but was driven more by cost control than visible AI monetization. This quarter, investors will be looking closely at product revenue growth, RPO trajectory, and any signs that Snowflake’s newer features like Cortex AI and Snowpark Containers are seeing measurable traction. The AI Data Cloud story is compelling, but to move the stock higher, Snowflake must prove it is winning real workloads and expanding usage — not just demoing new features. Gross margin and customer count detail will be key earnings call focal points. Snowflake (NASDAQ: SNOW) heads into its earnings report after the market closes today with investors watching closely for signs of margin discipline and execution in enterprise AI workloads. Shares are up more than 20% year to date, fueled by bullish sentiment around Snowflake’s positioning in the data infrastructure layer of the modern tech stack. But after a sharp miss one year ago and only modest improvements to operating leverage, the company still needs to prove it can convert product excitement into scalable, profitable growth. The Street expects first-quarter revenue of $1.01 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.21 — representing year-over-year growth of 21% and 51%, respectively. Those headline numbers are strong, but they come with an asterisk: Snowflake’s usage-based pricing model has led to uneven quarter-to-quarter trends, and many analysts are now more focused on remaining performance obligations (RPO) and net revenue retention (NRR) than simple top-line beats. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, who took over earlier this year, has emphasized streamlining the product suite and embedding generative AI tools into core workflows. The company’s “AI Data Cloud” narrative has gained traction with analysts, but actual monetization from new products like Cortex and Snowpark remains difficult to quantify. Investors are also watching for improvements in profitability. Last fiscal year, stock-based compensation accounted for over 40% of revenue — a figure that’s drawn increasing scrutiny from both institutional holders and sell-side coverage. With FY26 full-year EPS forecast at just $1.16 and GAAP profitability still elusive, this quarter needs to show more than just robust customer activity. Snowflake has a narrative tailwind — but to keep the stock’s valuation intact, it has to start delivering earnings momentum to match.

Of course, saving and investing the sum in the S&amp;P 500 would be a top choice for many. For others, using the amount as part of a down payment on a home would be a top choice. And, of course, for others looking to adapt their skillset for the artificial intelligence (AI) age, it&#8217;s all about investing in oneself to reskill ahead of the so-called fourth industrial revolution. In any case, let&#8217;s dig deeper into the case involving a 30-something who&#8217;s thinking deeply about where to put their coming windfall to work. From college, retirement, to a future home and experiences, let&#8217;s find out which expenditure would offer more bang for the buck. Key Points This Reddit user is weighing how to put their coming $80k inheritance to work. Should retirement, college, or something else take precedence? Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Option #1: Investing for retirement First up, we have good, old-fashioned investing for retirement. When in doubt, this is certainly never a bad idea, especially for those who are a bit behind when it comes to retirement milestones. For those who haven&#8217;t made good use of their tax-advantaged accounts, I&#8217;d suggest contributing and investing the proceeds in a run-of-the-mill S&amp;P 500 index fund with a low gross expense ratio. Vanguard and iShares boast the lowest fees out there with some of the most impressive liquidity, making them top picks for passive investors looking to invest their windfall wisely. Of course, there are active mutual funds that may claim to have a market-beating edge. But if you&#8217;re going to sacrifice 2% on what could be a long shot, I&#8217;d much rather go down the route of a passive investor with an S&amp;P 500 index fund or pick up shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), which has some brilliant minds deploying capital without a hefty expense ratio commanded by most actively-managed mutual funds. Whether you&#8217;re a big fan of Warren Buffett, his successor Greg Abel, or the other smart folks (Ajit Jain, Ted Weschler, and Todd Combs), you&#8217;re getting a star-studded lineup for a fairly low price of admission, at least in my opinion. Whether you choose ETFs, Berkshire Hathaway, or some other investment vehicle, putting an inheritance towards retirement is a wise move that&#8217;s sure to pay dividends (unless, of course, you&#8217;re going all-in on Berkshire!). Option #2: Investing in college What&#8217;s better than investing in your retirement? Investing in yourself. Warren Buffett thinks it&#8217;s the best thing you can do. It can&#8217;t be taxed or taken away from you, and it may very well score you the best returns in life. Of course, not all college degrees and diplomas will score you a high-paying job, especially as the disruptive aura of AI approaches. In any case, I&#8217;d be cognizant of AI and strive to pursue a career that can stand tall, even as the threat of automation rises. With Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently laying off 6,000, questions linger as to what the future holds for a wide range of professions, from coding to management. In any case, investing in college is a fantastic way to go, especially for those who aren&#8217;t content with their current careers. Additionally, upskilling, online certificates, and lighter-weight options should also be considered depending on one&#8217;s goals. Option #3: Down payment on a home Indeed, $80,000 isn&#8217;t quite enough for a home, but it can be enough for a down payment on a modest home. Of course, there is a degree of risk in taking out leverage, especially if one&#8217;s considering going back to college. Add the uncertainty of AI-induced automation into the equation, and a mortgage seems like it&#8217;d be riskier going into the 2030s, given that the stability of many forms of employment could come into question as AI moves at a blistering pace. Option #4: Family fund for experiences Finally, for someone who doesn&#8217;t really need the cash, given they&#8217;re already financially ahead, spending down a big chunk of the sum isn&#8217;t the worst idea in the world. Of course, for frequent travellers seeking to get more mileage, a $80,000 vacation fund could be created so that one would be able to have enough to fund occasional trips in perpetuity. Based on the &#8220;4% rule,&#8221; one could draw down 4% per year (works out to $3,200 in this case) of the inheritance and have enough for a sweet trip every single year. Of course, between college and a vacation fund, I&#8217;d go with the former, especially since AI demands upskilling and adapting to the new breadth of careers that didn&#8217;t exist a decade ago, that will come to be.

MSFT,2025-05-13 08:00:04,The Stock Market Crash That Could Ruin Everything,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-stock-market-crash-that-could-ruin-everything-20250513.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"The stock market had a 20% reset in April, which lasted only a few days, if even that. Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.

By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk. Sit back and let dividends do the heavy lifting for a simple, steady path to serious wealth creation over time. Grab a free copy of “2 Legendary High-Yield Dividend Stocks“ now. Dividend-paying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enhance these benefits by pooling dozens or hundreds of such stocks, offering instant diversification, reduced single-stock risk, and low expense ratios. In 2025’s uncertain market, marked by tariffs and persistent inflation, dividend ETFs provide resilience and income stability. Pursuing this strategy ensures steady returns and growth, making it ideal for both novice and seasoned investors seeking financial security. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Any discussion of dividend ETFs must begin with Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). It is a top-tier dividend ETF, tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index with around 100 high-quality stocks like Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), each boasting more than 10 years of dividend growth. The ETF&#8217;s 3.7% yield and ultra-low 0.06% expense ratio make it cost-effective while limiting sector exposure to no more than 25% ensures diversification. SCHD’s 11.4% annualized return over a decade reflects its balance of income and growth. Because SCHD focuses on financially sound companies, the dividend ETF mitigates risks, offering investors stability. For those seeking high yield and reliability, SCHD stock is a must-own ETF for lifelong passive income. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE:VYM) tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, holding 589 stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), with no stock exceeding 4% of the portfolio. VYM&#8217;s 2.7% yield and 0.06% expense ratio deliver strong value, while its 13.3% five-year annualized return highlights its consistency. VYM also offers broad diversification across sectors like energy and financials, reducing volatility, making it ideal for conservative investors. With tariff&#8217;s top-of-mind for investors these days, the ETF&#8217;s U.S.-focused holdings provide resilience against global disruptions. Its proven track record and low costs makes VYM a foundational ETF for steady dividend income and long-term wealth building. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG) targets companies with over 10 years of dividend increases, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and holds 338 stocks in its portfolio. The ETF&#8217;s 1.8% yield is lower, but its focus on dividend growth drives an 11.2% annualized return over the past decade. VIG&#8217;s 0.05% expense ratio is also among the lowest, maximizing investor returns. The Vanguard dividend ETF’s tech- and consumer-heavy portfolio suits investors prioritizing capital appreciation alongside income. And for investors looking for exposure to stable, growing firms, VIG cushions against economic uncertainty. It&#8217;s another ETF sporting a blend of growth and income, making it a versatile choice for investors seeking a balance of dividends and upside potential. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO) The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:DGRO) tracks the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, holding over 400 stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and emphasizes its consistent dividend growth. DGRO sports a 2.3% yield and 0.08% expense ratio, offering a balanced income stream and a 16.4% annualized return over five years. The ETF&#8217;s diversified sector exposure, including financials and healthcare, minimizes risk. In today&#8217;s volatile market, the ETF&#8217;s focus on resilient, dividend-growing companies counters the extreme swings the market is experiencing. DGRO’s low cost and steady performance make it an excellent choice for investors seeking dependable income with moderate growth in a challenging economic landscape. ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) The last dividend ETF to consider is ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEARCA:NOBL), which tracks the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. It holds over 60 stocks, each with over 25 years of dividend increases, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW). With a 2.5% yield and 0.35% expense ratio, it reflects NOBL&#8217;s premium quality, which has generated 14.5% annualized returns over the last five years. The ETF&#8217;s equal-weighted approach also reduces concentration risk, while its focus on elite dividend payers ensures stability. NOBL’s defensive holdings, with a long history of thriving amid uncertainty, offer investors reliable payouts. For those prioritizing quality and consistency, NOBL’s proven resilience makes it a stellar long-term holding for passive income.

MSFT,2025-05-05 12:02:06,I’m curious about dividend investing – What age and allocations are others using?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/im-curious-about-dividend-investing-what-age-and-allocations-20250505.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Dividend investing may be more favored by older investors who value passive income over growth and capital appreciation. However, investing in dividend payers can be a wise move, regardless of one&#8217;s age. Arguably, it&#8217;s better to go for the proven blue chips with dividends as a beginning investor than jump into the deep end with incredibly volatile but exciting growth stocks. When it comes to hot growth stocks, the stakes are higher, and a new investor may be more inclined to &#8220;chase&#8221; momentum and be startled out of a position when such momentum reverses. In any case, there&#8217;s really no right age to take on more of a dividend strategy. Ultimately, it depends on one&#8217;s needs, goals, and tolerance for risk. Most young people should be in growth mode as they look to maximize the appreciation of their nest eggs. And while dividends can be a nice-to-have for such new, young investors, it&#8217;s worth noting that a dividend strategy isn&#8217;t always the most tax-efficient way to go. Additionally, a dividend-focused strategy is not a proven way to beat the markets consistently over the long haul. A t the end of the day, more money paid out in dividends means less for a company to reinvest into its growth drivers. Often, lower growth means higher dividend yields, and vice versa. Though some exceptions can be made during the depths of a stock market correction or crash. In this piece, we&#8217;ll look at common approaches among investors in different age groups to help readers better find the right allocation. Key Points Younger investors should favor growth over yield while gradually transitioning as they age and their passive income needs grow. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Younger investors: Go for growth Young investors in their 20s and 30s should seek to have a heavier allocation towards the types of growth stocks that have little (or no) dividends. Indeed, we&#8217;re talking about yields south of the 1% mark. And while a few extra dollars in dividend income are nice to have, one must remember that any such dividends should be reinvested anyhow to jolt one&#8217;s growth. In any case, I think it makes less sense to have more than 25% of one&#8217;s equity portfolio in high-yielding dividend stocks unless there&#8217;s some specific passive income need that needs to be met. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which yields 0.84%, stands out as a perfect holding for a younger investor who prioritizes capital gains over dividends. And while the yield is quite small, I am a fan of the dividend growth trajectory as the company executes on the AI boom. With around 30% of code reportedly now generated by AI, at least according to CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft seems to have the perfect AI flywheel that could power it to robust gains over the long haul. Middle-aged investors: Go for dividend growth For someone in middle age, opting for a dividend and growth mix seems to make the most sense. Whether that entails 50% in dividend stocks and 50% in higher-growth names, finding the right balance as one begins the process of winding down in their 40s and 50s for a potentially early retirement could prove wise. Additionally, dividend-growth stocks that have a long history of raising dividends by double-digit percentage amounts in any given year could be an excellent choice. For instance, shares of the Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stand out as a stellar option, given its robust dividend and respectable growth profile. The home improvement firm has a wide moat surrounding its corner of the market, which has allowed it to average around 15% in dividend growth over the past five years. With a solid 2.56% dividend yield and above-average dividend growth prospects, HD stock stands out as a perfect bet for dividend investors in their 40s or 50s. Retirement age: Doubling down on passive income Finally, someone in retirement may wish to go heavier on the dividend stocks. While it may still be hard to live off dividends alone, I do think that those with enough passive income streams (think pensions, Social Security, etc) may have the opportunity to minimize the withdrawal from their invested principal. For such income-focused retirees, the iShares International Select Dividend ETF (IDV) stands out, with a nice 5.6% yield and broad exposure to the developed international markets beyond the U.S. Also, as the tariff war continues, the international financial markets may not have as much downside risk as the S&amp;P 500.

Initial expenses encompass acquiring licenses, tailoring the system to meet particular organizational requirements, educating personnel, and assimilating with current IT infrastructures. Ongoing expenses are incurred due to continuous maintenance, system upgrades, and licensing for the license management software. For SMEs and cost-sensitive businesses, these financial obligations frequently surpass the anticipated advantages, hindering market adoption and promoting manual or hybrid tracking methodologies. Complex and Diverse Licensing Models Across Vendors: Vendors currently provide more complex licensing structures, including per-seat, per-core, concurrent user, metered usage, and subscription models. Managing licenses is greatly complicated by the intricate web of diverse contractual terms and compliance standards.

The absence of standardization among software suppliers elevates administrative expenses and subjects firms to unintentional non-compliance risks, hence diminishing the efficiency benefits of automation solutions. Integration Challenges with Existing IT Infrastructure: For numerous companies, particularly those utilizing legacy or hybrid cloud systems, the integration of a contemporary license management platform is complex. Disparate data silos, bespoke apps, and obsolete ERP systems frequently impede seamless integration.

High Implementation and Integration Costs: While BaaS diminishes the price associated with constructing blockchain infrastructure from the ground up, overall implementation costs might be considerable. Organizations must allocate resources for customisation, user training, legacy system integration, and post-deployment maintenance. For SMEs, the initial and recurring expenses remain high, deterring adoption despite the technology's promise for long-term ROI. Limited Availability of Blockchain Expertise: Blockchain continues to be a specialized competency inside the global labor market. Many firms lack the internal technical expertise necessary to efficiently implement, scale, and secure BaaS infrastructures.

After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

It took 15 years to regain that level after a collapse. That year&#8217;s drop hammered it to 1,114 in October, a 78% drop. When it peaked that March, it had risen by 800% in the previous five years. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The stock market could drop by more than half Worry about inflation and AI valuations. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A similar drop in the value of the Nasdaq today would take it from its 20,0000 peak two months ago to 5,400. It seems impossible, but is it? A few of the largest cap stocks in the world have had huge runups in the last five years. Nvidia has risen 1,433%, and several other Magnificent Seven stocks have almost tripled. The cause of the Nasdaq&#8217;s collapse today would be very different from that of 2000. Hundreds of companies that went public a quarter of a century ago were losing money. When the capital available to them dried up, the shares of most collapsed, and some went out of business. Even companies with strong prospects, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), took share price beatings. Three factors would cause a deep drop in the market. The first is that the market is considered rich on multiple levels. The S&amp;P 500 PE is 26, which is high unless this year’s earnings are strong across the market. Two other things could crush the market. The first is hyperinflation, which tariffs, the equivalent of a tax on everything from cars to toys, would bring on. American household income will be unable to keep up with double-digit price surges. True hyperinflation occurs when prices go up 50%. Inflation hit the U.S. by 18% in 1980, driven to some extent by energy prices. The Fed raised rates to 19%. The economy was pounded into a recession from 1980 to 1982, and the stock market took a brutal beating. The other significant risk is an AI valuation implosion. Big tech shareholders already worry that the industry has invested more money in AI than it can get as a return on investment in the next few years. Companies have already prepared to invest tens of billions of dollars in server farms to expand because the US does not have that supply today. They have also invested or plan to put billions of dollars into Nvidia&#8217;s (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips. Nvidia&#8217;s value relies on that continuing. The more dangerous and harder-to-forecast problem is that AI could begin to threaten humans. It is not an edge case. Wide-regarded Scientific American recently wrote, “Artificial intelligence algorithms will soon reach a point of rapid self-improvement that threatens our ability to control them and poses great potential risk to humanity.” From an investor’s standpoint, AI could lose most, if not all, of its value, under those circumstances. It is hard to believe that the stock market could lose all of its value, but not that many decades ago, it did.

U.S. to Isolate China 12:53 pm U.S. authorities are preparing to engage in talks with over 70 countries, urging them to block Chinese goods from passing through their territories, according to the WSJ. The U.S. aims to economically &#8220;cut off&#8221; China. This aligns with President Trump&#8217;s recent statement suggesting nations might need to choose between aligning with the U.S. or China. The approach seems to focus on fully isolating China, while China has pledged to stand firm. Technology Stocks Upgrades and Downgrades 11:00 am MSFT (Microsoft) Downgrade Details: BMO Capital reduced price target from $490 to $470, maintains Outperform rating. Reason: Slower growth in Azure&#8217;s legacy cloud business due to weaker economy, leading to reduced Azure growth estimates for next few quarters and FY26. Insight: Experts indicate slowdown in core legacy cloud businesses. BMO suggests lower capex intensity in FY26 could be a positive catalyst for shares. NVDA (Nvidia) Issue: U.S. Government now requires licenses to ship H20/equivalent AI chips to China and arms-embargoed countries. Nvidia announced $5.5B charge in fiscal Q1 for inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves. Impact: Charge suggests high likelihood of H20 restrictions and low chance of future licenses. Q1 GAAP EPS may take a 20% hit, but non-GAAP sales/EPS less affected. Analyst View: BofA calls restriction &#8220;unwelcome but somewhat expected,&#8221; deems risk &#8220;manageable.&#8221; Maintains Buy rating, but lowered price target from $200 to $160. MRVL (Marvell) Downgrade Details: BofA cut price target from $120 to $72, retains Buy rating. Context: Expects Q1 results to beat due to conservative outlooks and tariff-related demand pull-ins. However, tariffs pose risks: Modest tariffs: 4%-6% sales hit, 12%-13% EPS hit. Deeper tariffs: 9% and 12% sales decline in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Reason: Lowered targets across semis coverage due to growing tariff uncertainty. TSLA (Tesla) Downgrade Details: Piper Sandler reduced price target from $450 to $400, maintains Overweight rating. Reason: Q1 deliveries (337,000 units) missed consensus, likely pushing gross margins to multi-year lows. Lack of clarity on Model 2 specs/pricing hinders reliance on new products for growth. Outlook: Short-term bearish due to weak Q1 financials, but &#8220;big picture&#8221; catalysts could drive sharp rallies. Estimates cut to reflect challenging near-term outlook. The semiconductor sector’s woes are hammering tech ETFs, with funds heavy in Nvidia and other chipmakers leading the market’s slide. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), packed with names like Nvidia, AMD, and ASML, cratered over 3.75% after the U.S. tightened export controls on AI chips to China. Nvidia, the ETF’s top holding, warned of a $5.5 billion charge as its H20 processors now require export licenses. The restrictions also hit AMD as the company export controls to apply to MI308 products, resulting in $800 million. Both stocks plunging close to 6% so far today. ASML, a key supplier of chip-making equipment, sank 5.75% after dismal order numbers and tariff warnings. Nasdaq Composite: -1.76% S&amp;P 500: -1.00% Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.42% Today&#8217;s selling pressure raised the CBOE VIX index 3% after market fear dissipated the past two days.

Ever since President Donald Trump announced his policy of reciprocal tariffs to level the international trade playing field, the stock and bond markets have both become cyclonic in their volatility. 2,000+ point intraday swings in either direction on the Dow Jones Average and a 50 basis point swing for the 10-year Treasury Bond yield in less than a month have given even veteran investors bouts of nausea. As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Navigating Through A Huge Menu Of Selections The huge array of available investment selections can be intimidating and overwhelming neophyte investors. A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action. Taking a closer look at SCHD and VOO is probably a prudent step to accomplish this step. (All market quote details are as of the time of this writing.)

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.

Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) is the lead EU regulator for X due to the location of its EU operations in the country. It has the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company's global revenue under the EU's strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); The inquiry will look at ""the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts posted on the X social media platform by EU/EEA users, for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models,"" the DPC said in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump and other members of his administration have criticised EU regulation of U.S. companies and described fines imposed on U.S. tech companies by the EU as a form of taxation. X owner Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a top adviser to Trump, has also railed against EU regulations, mainly those imposed directly by Brussels on online content. The decision follows a court case last year in which the Irish regulator sought an order to restrict X from processing the data of EU users for the purposes of developing its AI systems. X agreed to stop training its AI systems using personal data collected from EU users before they had the option to withdraw their consent. The Irish regulator ended its court proceedings weeks later, saying X had agreed the limits on a permanent basis. The powerful Irish privacy regulator has fined the likes of Microsoft's LinkedIn, TikTok and Meta since it was given sanctioning powers in 2018. Its fines to date of Meta total almost 3 billion euros. X, or Twitter as it was then called, has not faced sanctions since the DPC fined it 450,000 euros ($511,000) in 2020, the first penalty the regulator handed out under the new data privacy system.

MSFT,2025-04-11 08:40:00,OpenAI accuses Musk of harassment in lawsuit,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/openai-accuses-musk-of-harassment-in-lawsuit-20250411.jpeg,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com,"OpenAI has filed a countersuit against Elon Musk, accusing him of attempting to damage the company through “harassing legal claims” and a “sham” $97.4 billion takeover bid. The AI firm, which Musk helped found in 2015 before departing in 2018, has asked a US court to block any further actions by the billionaire and hold him liable for the disruption already caused. Musk has criticised OpenAI’s transition from a non-profit to a for-profit structure backed by major investors such as Microsoft. OpenAI alleges the public nature of Musk’s offer created confusion and harmed its operations and investor relations. It called the move a “fake takeover bid” designed to destabilise the company’s future. OpenAI recently raised $40 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank and estimates that ChatGPT has 500 million weekly users. The company projects losses of $5 billion this year, rising to $14 billion annually by 2026. A jury trial is scheduled for 2026. New Era Helium CEO Will Gray joined Steve Darling from Proactive to provide a detailed operational update and outline the company’s forward-looking development strategy. Gray highlighted ongoing progress across multiple business fronts, including the Pecos Slope Plant project, helium offtake planning, and the company's parallel expansion into AI-driven infrastructure through its joint venture, Texas Critical Data Centers, LLC (TCDC). At the Pecos Slope Field, New Era Helium is actively engaged with its midstream gatherer and processor following a recent transition in both the ownership and management of that third-party entity. Discussions remain constructive, with NEH focused on securing an outcome that is both operationally efficient and financially beneficial. However, Gray acknowledged that as a result of these negotiations, along with delays in securing project financing during the company’s recent de-SPAC process, the construction timeline for the Pecos Slope Plant has been extended. To mitigate potential delays and maintain momentum toward monetization, NEH has initiated contingency planning for helium offtake agreements. These efforts are running in parallel with construction timelines and are designed to ensure flexibility in commercial arrangements. The company remains in active dialogue with current counterparties while exploring new agreements to unlock long-term value and ensure a robust path to revenue generation from its helium assets. NEH stands out as one of only two companies trading on a major U.S. exchange with both proved and probable helium reserves, positioning it as a rare and de-risked opportunity in the helium investment landscape. Despite current production from its properties, the company is not receiving payment under its existing marketing agreement, which has surpassed its primary term and now operates on a month-to-month basis. The company is evaluating its options to optimize the commercial structure moving forward. Beyond its helium and natural gas operations, New Era Helium is also making strategic progress on its data center initiative through its joint venture with Sharon AI, Inc. The JV entity, Texas Critical Data Centers (TCDC), has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire 200 acres in Ector County, Texas, for the development of a 250MW net-zero AI and high-performance computing (HPC) data center. This facility will be powered in part by NEH’s own natural gas reserves, aligning with its vision for an integrated energy and digital infrastructure platform.

The precious metal was trading at $3,219.93 an ounce by midday, driven by renewed investor appetite for safe-haven assets amid market turbulence triggered by US trade policy. “Gold continues to attract buyers who continue to look for safe havens amid the weaker dollar, and the relentless stream of competing tariff headlines,” said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation. “But it is now up over 8% since Wednesday, so ‘caveat emptor.’ Silver has yet to garner the same level of interest as gold.” The Royal Mint also reported strong demand for physical gold, including coins and bars, as investors look to hedge against geopolitical and economic uncertainty. The surge in gold has supported London-listed miners and boosted wider interest in precious metals. Endeavour was up 6% and Fresnillo 5.5%. OpenAI has filed a countersuit against Elon Musk, accusing him of attempting to damage the company through “harassing legal claims” and a “sham” $97.4 billion takeover bid. The AI firm, which Musk helped found in 2015 before departing in 2018, has asked a US court to block any further actions by the billionaire and hold him liable for the disruption already caused. Musk has criticised OpenAI’s transition from a non-profit to a for-profit structure backed by major investors such as Microsoft. OpenAI alleges the public nature of Musk’s offer created confusion and harmed its operations and investor relations. It called the move a “fake takeover bid” designed to destabilise the company’s future. OpenAI recently raised $40 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank and estimates that ChatGPT has 500 million weekly users. The company projects losses of $5 billion this year, rising to $14 billion annually by 2026. A jury trial is scheduled for 2026.",https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1069529/gold-hits-new-high-putting-precious-metals-miners-atop-the-leader-board-1069529.html

However, he&#8217;s still more than worth listening to when it comes to tech, wealth, investment, and life in general. He remains one of the richest men on the planet, and he&#8217;s been quite vocal in recent years, especially amid the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), a profound technology that could reshape our lives in the coming decade. Recently, Gates stated his belief that AI will replace many jobs within the next decade. Doctors and teachers, often viewed as relatively well insulated from AI&#8217;s disruptive impact, may not be as immune as they think, as the rise of physical AI sweeps through the broader economy. Sure, we may all be distracted by Trump tariffs of late. But let&#8217;s not forget about AI and its ability to transform everything in as little as a few years. In any case, Bill Gates&#8217; views that AI will eventually replace numerous professionals may be alarming to some, horrifying to others. And while Gates&#8217; words aren&#8217;t to be taken as gospel, I do think it&#8217;s wise to heed the man&#8217;s warnings. Today, AI is the least capable it&#8217;ll ever be. It&#8217;s onward and upward from here, and the pace of improvement, I believe, may still be discounted by many, as training data runs dry while AI attempts to shift gears to become more of a specialized driver of corporate profits. Key Points When Bill Gates speaks, it&#8217;s worth listening to what he has to say, given his mastery of tech and wealth. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Here are three points that Gates nails as today&#8217;s young people look to adapt to the AI disruption that&#8217;s to come: The financially successful have a responsibility to give back If you&#8217;ve amassed a level of wealth that&#8217;s above and beyond your personal needs (and the needs of your loved ones), Gates believes that it&#8217;s time you&#8217;ve got the responisbility to give back to society. Indeed, whether we&#8217;re talking about giving consistently to charitable causes (it can also reduce your tax bill) or starting a philanthropic fund, Gates highlights giving back as taking precedence over climbing up the net worth ranks forever. For Gates, who decided a long time ago that he&#8217;ll eventually give away &#8220;virtually&#8221; everything, it&#8217;s more about the impact of one&#8217;s contributions than having more figures in the bank account. Save like a pessimist, but invest like an optimist. Saving like a pessimist and investing like an optimist is one way to supercharge one&#8217;s wealth creation journey. Though it&#8217;s good to be optimistic about the future of America, one should ensure they&#8217;re not overly optimistic to the point of chasing red-hot growth stocks in search of a quick double. Through his investment fund, Cascade Investments, Gates&#8217; investment manager incorporates a pretty boring, buy-and-hold strategy that aims to build wealth over the long haul. Indeed, Gates&#8217; fund makes few, if any, moves in many quarters. By playing the long game and saving aggressively, one can get to a level where they&#8217;ve got enough to think about giving more to causes they believe in. AI brings forth an era of &#8220;free intelligence&#8221; — it&#8217;s time to acquire AI skills. Finally, AI is an elephant in the room that&#8217;s not to be ignored. As AI agents begin to get to work, it&#8217;s your job to sharpen your skills to stay ahead of the wave of AI competition that will arise. Indeed, burying one&#8217;s head in the sand may make some feel better in the interim. However, in the long haul, one must either boost their AI skills and augment themselves to stay ahead of their potential robot replacements or run the risk of being left behind. Of course, Gates is an advocate of continuous learning — a skill that could make humans invaluable as we enter what Gates refers to as an era of &#8220;free intelligence.&#8221; Whether gaining AI skills entails learning how to prompt better or actually learning the ins and outs of data science and AI inference, there are numerous ways to reskill as the AI wave works its way through the world economy.The post I Don&#8217;t Agree with Bill Gates on Everything, But He Nails These 3 Points About Wealth appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/personal-finance/2025/03/31/i-dont-agree-with-bill-gates-on-everything-but-he-nails-these-3-points-about-wealth/
MSFT,2025-04-01 10:30:43,Donald Trump Campaigned on Cutting Corporate Taxes – Where Does That Promise Stand Today?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/donald-trump-campaigned-on-cutting-corporate-taxes-where-does-20250401.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"President Donald J. Trump’s 2024 electoral campaign was buoyed by the hope that his leadership would return the economic prosperity of his previous term, which had been decimated by Bidenomics and rampant Congressional spending, fueling inflation to the worst levels in 40 years. Central to President Trump’s strong economic performance from 2016-2020 was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. TCHA resulted in unprecedented business growth, new entrepreneurism, historically low unemployment among all ethnic groups, and consumer confidence soaring to an 18-year high. The 21% corporate rate is one of the few permanent aspects to TCJA not subject to expiration. President Trump has been adamant about the need to renew TCJA, as other key provisions expire in December, 2025. He is also proposing additional tax cuts, such as taxes on overtime, tips, Social Security payments, and has even proposed eliminating federal income tax altogether, to be replaced with revenues from a national consumption tax and tariffs. However, analysts have debated the merits of further tax cuts, the impact on the national debt, and whether or not Congress would ultimately be able to legislate these proposals into law. Key Points The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) delivered unprecedented business growth and entrepreneurism, in addition to additional retained money in the pockets of a majority of American citizens. President Trump campaigned on cutting taxes further on a number of fronts, including renewal of TCJA before its expiration in December, 2025. Many analysts who have debated over the effectiveness of further tax cuts fail to include the massive regulatory cuts, the large pending reductions in wasteful spending being identified by DOGE, and the resultant job creation, business growth, and fresh investment into US business as a result of the tariff policies. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Arguments Against Tax Cuts and The Truth Senator Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is one of the main opponents to tax cuts and reduced spending that take away power from Democrats&#8217; pet projects. Not surprisingly, the entirety of elected Democrats, as well as left-leaning Republicans, have been the loudest voices against cutting taxes. Democrat leaders like Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have been among the more articulate critics, although their mantras about “tax cuts would only be for the top 1%” and that “the rich don’t pay their fair share” have been thoroughly debunked by genuine statistics and even left leaning Factcheck.org. In actuality, TCJA benefited over 75% of all US taxpayers, and it has been verified that the top 1%, in fact, pay 40% of the entirety of federal income tax. The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis projects that a TCJA extension would create increased deficits based on reduced tax revenues from present levels. It forecasts a $4.6 trillion shortfall over 10 years, accounting for interest on outstanding federal debt. The Tax Policy Center projected that economic growth would offset only 6% of the shortfall. One crucial point is that neither the CBO or TPC prognostications take into account any significant spending cuts nor how tariffs will accelerate cutting deficits, as well as other key policy ramifications already in effect in the Trump Administration: How tariffs are creating fresh US investment, new businesses, and more crucial private sector jobs. The impact of lower tax rates and the elimination of onerous Biden-imposed regulatory burdens are jump-starting new manufacturing and other major business creation. How ending potential trillions in fraudulent, misappropriated, and likely criminal spending waste from USAID and numerous other federal agencies uncovered by DOGE will accelerate the goal towards eliminating the trillions in federal debt overhang via drastically reduced spending. Why a national consumption tax effectively rebuts Democrat opponents’ claims of “unfairness” and “only favoring the rich”. Trump Fiscal Policy Results In The First 60+ Days Cutting the trillions of wasteful and criminal spending of taxpayer dollars uncovered by Elon Musk and DOGE could accelerate President Trump&#8217;s plans to fix the US economy and restore manufacturing and other critical businesses. Since taking office in January, the threat of Trump&#8217;s tariffs has already created a seismic shift in the corporate business environment. For example: In response to prospective 25% tariffs on products made in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor, the maker of all of the GPUs from Nvidia and AMD required to run Artificial Intelligence, announced a $100 billion investment into new factories to be located in AZ for making GPUs and other semiconductor products expressly for the US market. SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan pledged to invest $50 billion in the US to create 50,000 new jobs. Apple announced it invested $500 billion for AI servers to be built in Michigan and Texas, creating 20,000 new jobs. Oracle, ChatGPT, and OpenAI announced its Stargate JV would invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure construction, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in various states, commencing with Texas. The revival of US-manufactured steel and copper is already underway, thanks to US tariffs to prevent dumping from China and other nations into the US market. Additionally, Elon Musk’s DOGE has been uncovering misappropriated taxpayer funds, payments to nonexistent recipients, and useless pork projects ostensibly designed to serve as political kickbacks and bribes to overseas entities, all of which are in the process of being cut. The anticipated spending cuts, something not factored into the CBO calculations, could drastically accelerate the rate of reducing the federal debt. A recent CBS poll found that 77% of the American public supports the work of DOGE. Lastly, a consumption tax, proposed as a 14-17% tax on all new goods except for food and medicine, would be a tax that visibly and unequivocally hits the wealthiest the hardest, thus debunking any accusations about unfairness. With no loopholes, a flat consumption tax is based on the value of the purchased item. Since expensive goods that are only affordable for the wealthy have a higher price tag, the commensurate tax revenues from those items will generate more tax revenues. President Trump was given a mandate by the electorate. While he has already enacted some of his plans to good effect, his tax and regulatory cutting proposals will still require much combating with Democrats, the predominant recipients of high taxes and big government spending. Over the next 4 years, the results of these battles will determine the extent of the initiatives’ full financial benefits.

All of these luxury brands and about 65 others all have a few things in common: they are high demand, top-dollar price tagged, and are all owned by LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE (OTC: LVMUY), the Paris, France headquartered luxury conglomerate helmed by Bernard Arnault. Arnault’s savvy management and focus on high-end, top of the line products has catapulted him into multibillionaire status, with a net worth that fluctuates between rivalling and even exceeding that of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, based on the stock price of LVMH at any given time. Despite the vast differences in the types of companies they find attractive and demographics of their respective customer bases for those companies, Arnault and Buffett share a “buy and hold” long term investment strategy mindset, and investors can find useful applications for several of the underlying rationales for how Arnault invests, even without the billions at his disposal. Key Points Both Warren Buffett’s and Bernard Arnault’s investing successes are based on a “buy and hold” strategy, although Berkshire Hathaway and LVMH could not be more unlike as corporate entities. In terms of stock price appreciation, Berkshire Hathaway has appreciated 2,800% over 30 years (1993-2023), while in the same time period, LVMH grew 100,000%. Although Arnault acquires a controlling interest in most of his companies like Buffett, there are underlying principles and rationales for his selections, which individual investors can also learn from and utilize. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Optimistic In The Long Term; Pessimistic In The Short Term Tiffany&#8217;s renowned reputation for premium jewelry and artistic craftmanship made it a must-have brand for LVMH to acquire. Whereas Warren Buffett characteristically pursues conservative companies with solid earnings that are undervalued, Arnault is much more aggressive, preferring high growth potential companies with high quality products that have underachieved through poor management or marketing. By investing in new designs and marketing, Arnault believes true value will eventually be achieved. Additionally, whereas Buffett’s modus operandi is to buy companies at bargain levels as low as possible to offset risk, Arnault has no qualms about paying a premium to acquire control over highly desired brands that he can then escalate even further. Buffett’s approach concentrates much more on intrinsic value and earnings and eschews hype or popularity, and is focused on solidly established industries, such as consumer goods, insurance, railroads, food, and banking. This explains Berkshire Hathaway’s late involvement in investing in technology. Conversely, Arnault’s focus on the luxury goods sector has helped LVMH to nearly corner the market on certain top brand couture, perfumes, champagnes, and accessories. That said, Arnault values diversification with synergy, as he has also branched out into related sectors like media and technology, especially if they can contribute to increasing value for his other holdings. While Arnault’s approach is unequivocally higher risk, the returns have been stellar. In a 30 year stretch from 1993 to 2023, Berkshire Hathaway stock grew 2,800%. In that same period, although much more volatile. LVMH grew 100,000%. Investing Tips for Retirees Berard Arnault&#8217;s acquisition selection principles can easily be applied to stock choices for one&#8217;s retirement portfolio. Bernard Arnault’s acquisition strategies are multimillion-dollar or even billion-dollar affairs. However, the underlying rationale for most of his acquisition choices are predicated on principles that will work to build any portfolio, and is something that retirees may especially wish to consider incorporating for their own stock picks: Quality Over Quantity &#8211; Some investors, especially Baby Boomers, are intimidated by the high prices of certain stocks, especially when they reach triple digits. However, if the investment is part of a growth portfolio, even 5 or 10 shares of a Magnificent 7 stock, such as Apple or Microsoft, will likely fare better than 100 shares of a company with more marginal upside potential. Look For Innovation &#8211; Companies that are not trying to innovate or who go on autopilot instead of investing in R&amp;D, will likely become stagnant over the long haul. The ones who are pushing the envelope will have a stronger chance for a big breakthrough, Think Globally &#8211; Arnault’s luxury brands have universal appeal in practically all contemporary societies, throughout all of the developed nations and emerging nations, to even Communist societies, where LVMH goods like Louis Vuitton handbags fetch enormous sums on the black market. Companies that market to the world as opposed to only a limited local market have a greater chance for long-term massive growth. On the topic of retirement, Arnault clearly loves what he does. He has led LVMH for 35 years and had the company’s by-laws for retirement extended twice, first to 80, and then to 85, when he himself reached age 76. His other advice to potential retirees would likely be to avoid it if you love what you’re doing.

You can get started with your own side hustle by leveraging your skills and developing a marketing plan. Consider your goals for your side hustle and track profits and expenses. Earn up to 3.8% on your money today (and get a cash bonus); click here to see how. (Sponsored) Side hustles have become extremely common for Americans looking to get some extra help paying the bills and perhaps to get ahead financially. In fact, a 2022 Zapier report found that a shocking 40% of all Americans had a side hustle. That&#8217;s up from just 34% in 2020. If you&#8217;re considering finding side work of your own, here are some tips on how successful side hustlers were able to get started and create a reliable income stream for themselves outside of their regular job. Leverage your specialized skills If you have a special skill or talent, finding a side gig that allows you to make money doing it can be a great option. Some examples include: Teaching music if you are great at playing an instrument Creating crafts, jewelry, or handmade furniture to sell on eBay or Etsy Applying for freelance writing gigs if you have a way with words You&#8217;ll want to make sure there is demand for whatever your skill is, of course. Look online to see if others have had success offering a similar type of goods and services, and see how they&#8217;ve priced their products and if they&#8217;ve managed to make their business a success. Be ready to market yourself It doesn&#8217;t matter how specialized your skill or how great your idea is if you can&#8217;t reach potential customers to tell them about what you are offering. To make sure you&#8217;re able to find people who want to pay for your goods or services, develop a marketing plan. This could include taking steps like buying ads on Google, selling on third-party marketplaces, creating a website listing your services or selling your goods, leveraging social media, or even reaching out via LinkedIn to people who are your target customers. Take advantage of apps There are a ton of apps out there that can help you get started with the side hustle lifestyle. If you want to walk dogs, for example, Rover could help you connect with people who are in need of your services. If you&#8217;re hoping to offer handyman services, you could use Thumbtack. Just be sure you understand exactly how the app works. Know when you&#8217;ll be charged fees, what amount you&#8217;ll have to pay, how pricing is set for your services, and whether you&#8217;ll actually be able to make a profit or not once you take all of the fees and costs into account. Decide on your goals It&#8217;s also worth considering exactly what your goals are when it comes to getting started with your side gig. For example, do you want to eventually replace your full-time job with the work you are doing, or are you just trying to make a little extra cash to put into your retirement plan? The answer to this question will shape the kind of side work you are doing, and will determine how much time and money you want to invest in getting your side business up and running. Track your expenses and profits Finally, you&#8217;ll want to keep track of how much money you are spending on your side hustle, as well as how much you are making, so you can ensure the hourly rate is actually worth it and that you&#8217;re making money. It&#8217;s a good idea to open a separate bank account that your side hustle money goes into, and that you pay costs out of, so you can ensure that you are turning a profit. Keeping the business money separate from your personal money will also be helpful if you decide to take your side gig full-time someday, as you will be treating the company like a real professional endeavor. By taking these steps, you can hopefully become one of the 40% of Americans who have a side hustle that helps you achieve your goals &#8212; and you can perhaps even make it a great success.

MSFT,2025-03-18 10:33:30,3 Cheap Vanguard ETFs I’d Buy In 2025,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/3-cheap-vanguard-etfs-id-buy-in-2025-20250318.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Vanguard has some of the best ETFs that are known for their low expense ratios. Lower costs allow you to keep more of the profits that your ETFs generate. Vanguard offers close to 100 ETFs that give investors access to major benchmarks, popular investment strategies, and sectors. Buying Vanguard ETFs during dips can lead to meaningful profits in the long run, especially if you can hold onto your shares for many years. Another great thing about their ETFs is that you don&#8217;t have to know much about the stock market to generate positive returns. A fund manager oversees the positions to ensure they align with the ETF&#8217;s stated goals. Investors who are looking for bargains and the potential for promising long-term returns may want to consider these three Vanguard ETFs. Key Points Vanguard has some of the best ETFs with low expense ratios. Discover some of the top Vanguard ETFs to buy that can increase your wealth. Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (VUG) The Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) has historically been an outperformer. It&#8217;s up by more than 170% over the past five years while the S&amp;P 500 has rallied by 145% during the same stretch. Despite the long-term gains, VUG looks promising due to its recent dip. The ETF is in the middle of a correction and has shed approximately 8% of its value year-to-date. VUG has 180 holdings and prioritizes large-cap stocks like the Magnificent Seven. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are the top three holdings, and they make up more than one-third of the fund&#8217;s total assets. VUG is a tech-heavy ETF. More than half of its capital is in the sector, and this high allocation is a common theme among ETFs that outperform the stock market. Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU) Not every investor wants to deal with high market volatility, especially as they get closer to retirement. The Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU) can give investors positive returns without the dramatic price movements of growth stocks in the tech sector. The fund has delivered respectable returns as well. It&#8217;s up by 24% over the past year and has delivered a 64% gain over the past five years. The fund has a reasonable 0.09% expense ratio and places a strong emphasis on electric utilities. A focus on utility stocks has resulted in a lofty 30-day SEC yield of 2.85%. You can earn solid cash flow from this ETF while growing your money. Utilities are essential, and they are one of the last expenses consumers and businesses will cut. The fund also has a 20.2 P/E ratio which trails the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 28.2 P/E ratio. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO) The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) tracks the S&amp;P 500 and looks more attractive after a correction. The fund gives investors exposure to tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia while they are still recovering from corrections. A market rally can send these stocks soaring and reward VOO investors. However, the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t just about tech stocks. Almost 70% of its total capital is allocated to sectors outside of tech. This diversification results in less volatility than the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. VOO has a 0.03% expense ratio and a 1.21% 30-day SEC yield. Unsurprisingly, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the top three positions. However, they only make up about 19% of the fund&#8217;s total assets. That&#8217;s less concentration than VUG. VOO is still down year-to-date, but its 146% rally over the past five years indicates the types of returns this fund can get when the stock market rebounds.

During Amazon&#8217;s fourth-quarter 2024 earnings call on Feb. 6, the company announced that its advertising revenue surged to $17.3 billion as Thursday Night Football set streaming records by averaging 13.7 million viewers. That ad revenue represented 18% quarter-over-quarter growth. Additional revenue drivers included strong retail holiday spending and AI services through AWS, the largest cloud provider in the world. The stock hit its all-time high of $242.52 on Feb. 4 in the lead-up to the Q4 earnings call. Outside of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon has been a Wall Street darling since the company&#8217;s initial public offering in May 1997 at a split-adjusted price of $0.07. Today, Amazon trades for about $218, meaning the stock is up more than 15,840% since January 2005. However, the only thing that matters from this point on is what the stock will do for the next one, five, and 10 years and beyond. Let’s crunch the numbers and give you our best guess about Amazon’s future share price. No one has a crystal ball, and even the Wall Street “experts” are often wrong more than they are right in predicting future stock prices. We will walk through our assumptions and provide you with the story around the numbers (other sites just pick a share price without explaining why they suggest the price they do). Key Points in this Article: Future stock performance hinges on Amazon&#8217;s growth in e-commerce, AWS, and advertising amidst increasing competition. Amazon posted net income of $59.2 billion in 2024, a 94.60% increase over 2023&#8217;s net income of $30.42 billion. Projections for net income over the next five years call for 4.5x.

Amazon&#8217;s Recent Stock Success Here&#8217;s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2017. Year Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $19.94 $89.0 ($.241) 2015 $15.63 $107.0 $.596 2016 $32.81 $136.0 $2.371 2017 $37.90 $177.9 $3.03 2018 $58.60 $232.9 $10.07 2019 $73.26 $280.5 $11.59 2020 $93.75 $386.1 $21.33 2021 $163.50 $469.8 $33.36 2022 $167.55 $514.0 ($2.72) 2023 $85.46 $574.78 $30.42 2024 $219.39 $637.96 $59.2 *Revenue and net income in billions From 2014 to 2024, Amazon&#8217;s revenue grew by 616.80%. The ride up wasn&#8217;t always smooth, however. For example, in 2020, sales jumped 38%, and net income nearly doubled. 2021 saw a continued boom as people moved to e-commerce shopping during Covid. However, all those sales being &#8220;pulled forward&#8221; led to challenges in 2022, and the company swung to a surprise loss. As Amazon embarks into the back half of the decade, a few different key areas will determine its performance. Three Key Drivers of Amazon&#8217;s Stock Performance E-commerce Success: While COVID-19 brought record sales to Amazon, it also led to many competitors investing heavily to compete with Amazon online. While e-commerce is still just 15% of retail sales, putting up huge growth rates in online sales won&#8217;t be as easy in the coming years as it was a decade ago. Amazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services first-quarter 2024 revenue was $25.04 billion and the unit should break $100 billion in total sales this year. However, the unit’s 13% year-over-year growth is not as fast as competing cloud services like Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc.&#8217;s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud. Amazon is at risk of falling behind Microsoft before 2030 if it cannot stop market share losses. Advertising: Amazon exited 2024 with $17.3 billion in advertising business during the fourth quarter alone. Advertising could be another high-margin business line. Amazon currently gets most of its profits from its AWS cloud business, which has led the company past $100 billion in annual profits. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for Amazon stock is $270.09, which is about 31.01% upside potential from today&#8217;s price. All but one of the 48 analysts covering Amazon recommend buying shares, with the stock receiving a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month forecast projects Amazon’s stock price to be $226.50. We see AWS continuing its current 12% growth rate but see Amazon’s advertising business outperforming analysts&#8217; expectations. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Forecast Through 2030 AWS: Assuming AWS stems its market share loss and investments in AI to counterbalance the threat from Microsoft and Google. E-commerce: Amazon continues to pour investments into e-commerce, forgoing added profits to maintain market share. Our case model assumes growth in new logistics and efficiencies from robotics in warehouses leads to this unit finally delivering strong operating profits. Advertising: Amazon&#8217;s advertising continued to grow to the now $47 billion business unit, and we see a high teens growth rate compounded annually. Add all these numbers up and take out some amount for &#8220;new bets&#8221; the company will surely be investing in (and a potential dividend boost) and we see revenue in 2030 at $1.15 trillion and $131 billion in net income. Today, the company trades for about 50X earnings, which we&#8217;ll take down to 35 times as the company matures (but continues showing growth). In our analysis, Amazon is worth $2.6 trillion in 2030. Here are our revenue, net income, and company size estimates through 2030: Year Revenue Net Income Total Enterprise Value 2024 $638 $48.56 $1.93 2025 $710 $62.13 $2.12 2026 $788 $79.68 $2.19 2027 $867 $96.53 $2.29 2028 $957 $114.17 $2.39 2029 $1,049 $136.69 $2.5 2030 $1,149 $131.39 $2.6 *Revenue and net income reported in billions and TEV in trillions Amazon&#8217;s Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 Amazon Stock&#8217;s Price Target for 2030 We estimate Amazon’s stock price to be $430.50 per share with 10% year-over-year revenue growth but compressed margins from more competition in its AWS unit. Our estimated stock price for Amazon will be 86.04% higher than the current stock price. Year Price Target Change From Current Price 2025 $226.50 9.87% 2026 $287.00 39.22% 2027 $371.00 79.97% 2028 $308.00 49.41% 2029 $361.90 75.55% 2030 $430.50 108.83% The post Amazon Stock (AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for March 5 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/03/12/amazon-stock-amzn-price-prediction-and-forecast/

Many retail investors have the money but are not sure how to get started in the stock market. With thousands of companies and stocks to choose from, it is natural to get confused. Fortunately, there are exchange-traded funds or ETFs that can help you with the task. These funds invest in individual stocks and help achieve diversification. All you need to do is choose an ETF that works with your risk appetite and investment goals. Growing market volatility has led several investors towards ETFs and the global ETF industry saw an inflow of $1.45 trillion in 2024. If you are ready to invest in ETFs, here are three ETFs to buy in March. Key points in this article: Investors are playing safe and looking for ETFs to park their money. Besides providing immediate diversification, ETFs also generate steady returns. If you are looking for individual stocks instead of an ETF, get your hands on our “The Next Nvidia” stocks, it has one stock with 10X potential. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF If you want a safe way to ride the stock market, consider the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). With a low expense ratio, it is one of the best ways to invest in the top U.S. companies. As of writing, VOO is trading at $546 and is close to the 52-week high of $563. It has generated 15% returns in a year and over 100% returns in five years. It holds 505 stocks and allocates 30% of the funds into the information technology sector, followed by 14% in the financial sector and 11% in the consumer discretionary industry. One good reason to invest in the ETF is that it follows the S&amp;P 500 and you will be able to own a piece of the top companies without having to pick them individually. Some of the fund’s top holdings include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), the four stalwarts leading the tech industry. It has an expense ratio of only 0.03% and the Assets Under Management are $498.5 billion. While it offers diversification to your portfolio, it is heavily dependent on the tech industry for majority gains. Hence, if you are optimistic about the growth of the tech sector, this is an ideal ETF to own. As long as the tech sector continues to post gains, VOO will keep soaring. Invesco QQQ The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is ideal for investors who want higher exposure to the tech sector. It follows the Nasdaq 100 and has an expense ratio of 0.15%. At the time of writing, QQQ is up 14% in the year and 146% in the past five years. Its NAV is $508 and is lower than the 52-week high of $540. Since its launch in 1999, the fund has shown strong performance and generated +443.43% higher returns than the S&amp;P 500. The Assets Under Management (AUM) of the fund is $171.86 billion. QQQ offers high exposure to the Magnificent Seven and allows you to own some of the most popular stocks. Its biggest holdings include Microsoft Corporation, Apple Inc., and NVIDIA, the three tech giants driving the market today. Over 50% of the fund’s holdings are in the tech sector followed by the consumer discretionary. Notably, the fund also owns stocks in different industries and has some long-term winners like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST). The solid diversification of the fund ensures that it stands strong when volatility hits the tech industry. Invesco QQQ is ideal for low-risk investors who seek steady growth and steady income. While it offers exposure to the technology sector, it maintains a strong balance in its total holdings. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF Cathie Wood’s ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NASDAQ: ARKF) focuses on companies that are transforming the financial sector through digital assets, blockchain, and mobile payments. It has an expense ratio of 0.75% and an NAV of $38.07. The fund has generated 31% returns in the year and 54% in the past five years. I believe the fintech industry is going through a solid transition and some of the biggest companies like Coinbase and Shopify will lead the change. There is optimism about the future of fintech and this ETF will help investors make the most of it. The fund allocation includes 39% in the technology sector followed by 28% in the financial services sector and 18% in communication services. The fund’s top three holdings include Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), Coinbase Global Inc (COIN), and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD). These three stocks are on a rally and have impressed the market with stellar financials. However, there is one risk associated with the ETF, if the financial sector falls, the returns will drop. However, the current situation suggests that the fintech sector is poised for growth. The fund has a low NAV, making it a strong buy at the current level. It is down from the 52-week high of $44. If you are someone who follows Cathie Wood’s investment decisions and is optimistic about the financial sector, this ETF is an exciting buy for the month.

Investors may have expected more from the AI darling.However, analysts said they're still bullish on the chipmaker's prospects, anticipating strong demand as Big Tech ramps up spending on AI infrastructure.Bank of America called Nvidia a ""top pick"" on its AI dominance and raised its price target for the stock. Nvidia (NVDA) shares gave up early gains Thursday after the chipmaker reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped Street estimates. Investors may have expected more from the AI darling. Shares were down about 3% at $127 in intraday trading. The stock has had a tough start to 2025, with shares down about 5% for the year so far, after nearly tripling in value in 2024. Better-than-expected results have become ""routine"" for Nvidia, Morgan Stanley analysts said, with expectations climbing ahead of the company's report. However, ""everything improves from here,"" the analysts said, and raised their price target to $162 from $152, pointing to Nvidia's strong outlook and ""language around 'amazing' levels of Blackwell demand."" Bank of America analysts called the stock a “top pick on AI dominance” and raised their price target to $200 from $190. Nvidia’s data center segment, which delivered record quarterly revenue, “potentially faces strong, long-term demand dynamics,” the analysts added. Several of Nvidia’s Big Tech buyers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), recently announced plans to raise their capital expenditures to fuel their AI ambitions. Wedbush analysis said the results showed “few (if any) blemishes” with “seemingly only good news ahead.” Nvidia’s annual GPU Technology Conference is in March, and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the company’s earnings call to expect “exciting things to come” including what’s next after its Blackwell line of chips. Wedbush maintained its price target of $175 and “outperform” rating. Nvidia reported $11 billion in quarterly revenue from Blackwell, which CFO Colette Kress said was the company’s fastest-ever product ramp, according to an earnings call transcript provided by AlphaSense. Going forward, Jefferies analysts said “the supply chain should continue to improve, and we see no signs of demand issues.” The analyst posted a price target of $185. Despite recent losses, Nvidia shares have added nearly two-thirds of their value over the past 12 months. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

(NASDAQ: NVDA) bounced back on Wednesday, gaining 3.67% in the lead-up to the company’s aftermarket Q4 2024 earnings call. Yesterday’s gain was a nice change of pace from recent losses, including the stock falling by -2.80% on Tuesday and -6.31% over the past five trading sessions. Nonetheless, the stock is up 10.86% over the past month and 65.99% over the past year. From an earnings perspective, NVIDIA handily outperformed expectations. The company beat on EPS and revenue by 5.22% and 3.08%, respectively. Nonetheless, after hours, the stock chopped around and ultimately ended -1.49% lower than it was at the close Over the past few years, AI has consistently fueled the largest gains for the market. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA. NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Over the past five years, shares have gained nearly 1,776%, and since going public, NVIDIA’s stock is up a preposterous 316,475%. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect significant upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 2024 $134.29 $60.974 $29.76 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin and Magnificent Seven mainstay looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $194.67 billion and $861.41 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.34 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) — account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants that are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $177.87, which represents 40.46% potential upside over the next 12 months based on today’s closing share price of $126.63.

As the longest-running bull market hit new highs in early 2020, the pandemic struck causing the Nasdaq 100 to lose more than a quarter of its value in a matter of weeks. Yet immediately after, the technology-oriented reversed course to go on a new 21-month tear, surging 139%, only to make another u-turn and lose one-third of its value in 2023. The Nasdaq 100 has doubled in value since that low point. This white-knuckle ride has only served to prove the adage that the only constant is change. While no one knows where the stock market will head tomorrow, let alone over the coming year, investors looking to trounce the index in 2025 should look no further than the two Vanguard funds below. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: The stock market has been on a tremendous bull run for years, albeit with some stomach-churning dips along the way. The Nasdaq 100 index, because of its heavy tech sector weighting, has been a stellar performer as the market has favored these companies. Vanguard is a premier asset manager known for its low fees, but it also offers ETFs that have handily outperformed the tech-heavy index in recent years and should outperform again. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) The Nasdaq 100 index, of course, is the 100 largest, non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Itis heavily weighted toward technology and growth stocks, including the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It’s why it tends to serve as a high-growth stock benchmark. Vanguard exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are best-known as the premiere strategy for low-cost, passive indexing and broad diversification. Many will track specific sectors, regions, or asset classes, so not all will match the Nasdaq 100’s tech-heavy growth, but some Vanguard ETFs focus on technology or growth stocks, making them the leading contenders to outperform the tech-heavy index. The following two are the best positioned to do so. Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT) tracks the MSCI U.S. Investable Market Information Technology index, focusing on tech companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple, and Nvidia. The ETF has delivered total returns of 66% over the last three years, just surpassing the Nasdaq 100’s of 64%. The Vanguard ETF’s heavy weighting in mega-cap tech stocks gives it the top shot at beating the index, especially if Nvidia and other chipmakers continue their artificial intelligence-fueled surge for the coming year. All eyes will be on Nvidia on this Wednesday as it reports fourth-quarter results after the market closes. Most analysts expect the AI chipmaker to post stellar results for the quarter, but it will be its guidance for the coming year that sets the tone. If it has a robust outlook, it could set the stock and the sector on fire once more, though more muted guidance could send stocks careening lower. Nvidia is the second largest holding in VGT at around 13%, second only to Apple and just ahead of Microsoft. Remarkably, over the last five years, the Vanguard ETF has done even better, beating the Nasdaq 100 145% to 138%. While Vanguard is well-known as the low-cost leader in ETFs, with cheap expense ratios, VGT’s tiny 0.09% ratio ensures that virtually all of your money put into the ETF is working for you and not enriching the money-manager. Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (MGK) Traditionally, investing in large and mega cap stocks meant slow, but steady growth. However, that’s changed in recent years, the market’s biggest stocks are all fast-growing tech stocks. In fact, eight of the 10 largest companies are all tech companies. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:MGK) tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth index, including many of the same tech giants as VGT, including Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon (which is technically classified as consumer discretionary but is seen by many as a growth-oriented tech stock). Over the past three years, MGK just eked out a win over the Nasdaq 100, offering total returns of 64.6%. Because its 50 to 60 largest growth stocks also include components of the index, it give MGK a strong overlap. However, its broader diversification has the potential to dilute its returns compared to Nasdaq 100, but that’s not how it has played out. Now it did have an impact over the last five years, but not by much. Where the tech index gained 138%, the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF gained 126%, so you weren’t giving up much by investing in it, while gaining downside protection from the diversified portfolio. Moreover, Its expense ratio is even better than VGT at 0.07%. Today, tech stocks are ascendant so that’s what MGK is heavily weighted towards, or 62.5% of its holdings. But if another sector rises strong and its leaders become mega cap giants, then the ETF will tilt towards them. It ensures that investors are always invested in the market’s biggest growth stocks, no matter what their underlying business is.

MSFT,2025-02-25 09:00:00,Materials developed at Purdue University incorporated into new Microsoft Quantum qubit platform,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/materials-developed-at-purdue-university-incorporated-into-new-microsoft-20250225.jpg,globenewswire.com,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., USA, Feb. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Microsoft Quantum published an article in Nature on Feb. 19 detailing recent advances in the measurement of quantum devices that will be needed to realize a topological quantum computer. Among the authors are Microsoft scientists and engineers who conduct research at Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette, located at Purdue University. In an announcement by Microsoft Quantum, the team describes the operation of a device that is a necessary building block for a topological quantum computer. The published results are an important milestone along the path to construction of quantum computers that are potentially more robust and powerful than existing technologies.“Our hope for quantum computation is that it will aid chemists, materials scientists and engineers working on the design and manufacturing of new materials that are so important to our daily lives,” said Michael Manfra, scientific director of Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette and the Bill and Dee O'Brien Distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy, professor of materials engineering, and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue. “The promise of quantum computation is in accelerating scientific discovery and its translation into useful technology. For example, if quantum computers reduce the time and cost to produce new lifesaving therapeutic drugs, that is real societal impact.” The Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette team advanced the complex layered materials that make up the quantum plane of the full device architecture used in the tests. Microsoft scientists working with Manfra are experts in advanced semiconductor growth techniques, including molecular beam epitaxy, that are used to build low-dimensional electron systems that form the basis for quantum bits, or qubits. They built the semiconductor and superconductor layers with atomic layer precision, tailoring the material's properties to those needed for the device architecture.Manfra, a member of the Purdue Quantum Science and Engineering Institute, credited the strong relationship between Purdue and Microsoft, built over the course of a decade, with the advances conducted at Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette. In 2017 Purdue deepened its relationship with Microsoft with a multiyear agreement that includes embedding Microsoft employees with Manfra's research team at Purdue.“This was a collaborative effort by a very sophisticated team, with a vital contribution from the Microsoft scientists at Purdue,” Manfra said. “It's a Microsoft team achievement, but it's also the culmination of a long-standing partnership between Purdue and Microsoft. It wouldn't have been possible without an environment at Purdue that was conducive to this mode of work — I attempted to blend industrial with academic research to the betterment of both communities. I think that's a success story.”Quantum science and engineering at Purdue is a pillar of the Purdue Computes initiative, which is focused on advancing research in computing, physical AI, semiconductors and quantum technologies.“This research breakthrough in the measurement of the state of quasi particles is a milestone in the development of topological quantum computing, and creates a watershed moment in the semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “Marking also the latest success in the strategic initiative of Purdue Computes, the deep collaboration that Professor Manfra and his team have created with the Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette on the Purdue campus exemplifies the most impactful industry research partnership at any American university today.”Most approaches to quantum computers rely on local degrees of freedom to encode information. The spin of an electron is a classic example of a qubit. But an individual spin is prone to disturbance — by relatively common things like heat, vibrations or interactions with other quantum particles — which can corrupt quantum information stored in the qubit, necessitating a great deal of effort in detecting and correcting errors. Instead of spin, topological quantum computers store information in a more distributed manner; the qubit state is encoded in the state of many particles acting in concert. Consequently, it is harder to scramble the information as the state of all the particles must be changed to alter the qubit state.In the Nature paper, the Microsoft team was able to accurately and quickly measure the state of quasi particles that form the basis of the qubit.“The device is used to measure a basic property of a topological qubit quickly,” Manfra said. “The team is excited to build on these positive results.”“The team in West Lafayette pushed existing epitaxial technology to a new state-of-the-art for semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures to ensure a perfect interface between each of the building blocks of the Microsoft hybrid system,” said Sergei Gronin, a Microsoft Quantum Lab scientist.“The materials quality that is required for quantum computing chips necessitates constant improvements, so that's one of the biggest challenges,” Gronin said. “First, we had to adjust and improve semiconductor technology to meet a new level that nobody was able to achieve before. But equally important was how to create this hybrid system. To do that, we had to merge a semiconducting part and a superconducting part. And that means you need to perfect the semiconductor and the superconductor and perfect the interface between them.”While work discussed in the Nature article was performed by Microsoft employees, the exposure to industrial-scale research and development is an outstanding opportunity for Purdue students in Manfra's academic group as well. John Watson, Geoffrey Gardner and Saeed Fallahi, who are among the coauthors of the paper, earned their doctoral degrees under Manfra and now work for Microsoft Quantum at locations in Redmond, Washington, and Copenhagen, Denmark. Most of Manfra's former students now work for quantum computing companies, including Microsoft. Tyler Lindemann, who works in the West Lafayette lab and helped to build the hybrid semiconductor-superconductor structures required for the device, is earning a doctoral degree from Purdue under Manfra's supervision.“Working in Professor Manfra's lab in conjunction with my work for Microsoft Quantum has given me a head start in my professional development, and been fruitful for my academic work,” Lindemann said. “At the same time, many of the world-class scientists and engineers at Microsoft Quantum have some background in academia, and being able to draw from their knowledge and experience is an indispensable resource in my graduate studies. From both perspectives, it's a great opportunity.” About Purdue University Purdue University is a public research university leading with excellence at scale. Ranked among top 10 public universities in the United States, Purdue discovers, disseminates and deploys knowledge with a quality and at a scale second to none. More than 107,000 students study at Purdue across multiple campuses, locations and modalities, including more than 58,000 at our main campus in West Lafayette and Indianapolis.
