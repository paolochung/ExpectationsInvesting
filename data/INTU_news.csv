Despite a 1% dip year-to-date in the share price, Nvidia&#8217;s underlying fundamentals remain robust based on its most recent performance. The company has the potential to shift the focus from tariffs back to earnings, which have largely beaten expectations so far. Most Wall Street analysts maintain a buy rating on NVDA stock, projecting an average 12-month price target of $164, a considerable upside from current levels of $132. Nvidia&#8217;s upcoming Q1 report is expected to shed light on the impact of tariffs implemented in early 2025. This follows strong Q4 results where the company surpassed Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings. At the time, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, âAI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.â NVDA stock is currently off fractionally while the SPX ETF is off by 0.37%. Tariff Tall Tale 12:24 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pushed back against President Donald Trump&#8217;s new tariff targeting Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhones, basically calling domestic production a tall tale. &#8220;We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the [U.S.] is a fairy tale that is not feasible,&#8221; Ives stated in a report. Trump threatened that Apple could face tariffs of 25% or more on iPhones made outside the USA. Apple recently revealed its intentions to redirect production of its iPhones from China to India. Apple stock is down 2.5% today, and the SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%. Fed Uncertainty 10:45 am by Gerelyn Terzo Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee cautioned Friday that President Donald Trumpâs latest tariff moves have complicated monetary policy decisions and likely pushed back any interest rate changes. The Fed previously revealed its intentions to lower interest rates twice in 2025. Goolsbee told CNBC, &#8220;Everythingâs always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while weâre waiting to get some clarity.&#8221; This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. A sharp sell-off gripped the markets this Friday morning, with all three major stock market averages surrendering ground. The week is set to conclude on a sour note, following President Trumpâs recent threat to levy a steep 50% tariff on the EU, a measure that could be implemented in the coming days. In a potentially encouraging sign, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses almost in half, while both the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have similarly come off their worst levels. The majority of economic sectors are trading lower, with consumer discretionary and technology stocks taking the hardest hits. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%, while the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for a 2.7% weekly decline. Bond yields are declining as the trade war escalates, bringing a volatile week for the bond market to a close. Stock market volatility has also reemerged, highlighted by a 25% increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is facing renewed pressure, with President Trump warning that iPhones produced outside the U.S. could be subject to substantial tariffs, causing Apple stock to drop 2% today. Yet, in a bright spot among the Magnificent Seven, prominent Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is optimistic about Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), boosting his price target on the electric vehicle manufacturer to $500, suggesting a 49% upside potential, alongside an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating. Hereâs a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 253.11 (-0.60%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 182.34 (-0.94%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.23 (-0.77%) Market Movers Nuclear stocks are defying the downward trend today, gaining ground as the Trump administration signals favorable conditions for the industry. Companies including Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), NuScale (NYSE: SMR), and Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) are all advancing, led by a double-digit percentage gain for OKLO. Quantum computing stock IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), however, is down as much as 4.7% today, following yesterday&#8217;s rally that saw its share price close above $45. In earnings developments, Intuit (NYSE: INTU) is gaining 8.6% today while Deckers (NYSE: DECK) is sinking 21.7% on a Wall Street downgrade following disappointing results on tariff impacts.

INTU,2024-07-30 09:05:00,Wrike Introduces New Features To Eliminate Workflow Inefficiencies for Professional Services Teams,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/wrike-introduces-new-features-to-eliminate-workflow-inefficiencies-for-20240730.jpg,https://www.businesswire.com,"SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wrike, the most intelligent work management platform, today announced new features that enable work to flow seamlessly for professional services teams, including marketing consultants and agencies, management consulting, IT Services, and architecture, engineering, and construction firms. Wrike for Professional Services now offers sweeping updates that power each stage of the client service delivery (CSD) workflow, including advanced capacity and resource planning, timesheet approvals, dashboard templates for reporting, and ERP integrations to streamline billing. These updates make Wrike the only work management platform with the versatility to support all contract types, billing models, and delivery methods. Together, Wrike is streamlining efficiency for professional services teams by consolidating resource management, time tracking, and project execution into one cohesive platform. âWhen we were reassessing our CSD capabilities, we talked to a number of professional services teams about their biggest pain points, and it always came down to workflow inefficiencies that were eating into their margins and inhibiting growth,â says Thomas Scott, CEO, Wrike. âTeams are still spread thin across disparate tools and systems, which creates barriers and makes work complex and time consuming. Work canât be compartmentalized. It needs freedom to flow. We now completely streamline the entire client service delivery workflow, from project scoping to billing. Our customers are excited about the new features weâre rolling out.â Professional services teams are struggling with a lack of pipeline visibility, difficulties with estimations, unpredictable capacity planning, challenging resource management, poor or delayed insight into project health/progress/financials, and even employee morale. Work is often fragmented across multiple teams and systems, wasting time and resources, disrupting decision making, and reducing high-ROI outcomes. Wrike research found that nearly 60% of professional services workers would like to use fewer software applications to do their jobs, and 83% say that a single source of truth will help them achieve results. To address these challenges, Wrike is introducing new features that bring all stages of the CSD workflow into Wrike, allowing teams to focus on the most impactful work, increase utilization, grow revenue, increase profit, and improve staff and client satisfaction. Capabilities include: Intelligent skills management and advanced resource planning Available now to all Pinnacle customers, this functionality enables users to plan capacity and manage resources based on skills, location, language, and other attributes. With insights provided in customized user fields, Wrike will suggest the best assignee based on matching skills and availability. Professional services leaders can then effectively staff projects and reduce burnout by assigning the right task to the right team member at the right time. Leaders can also identify and address skills gaps and training needs to build out their teamâs abilities. Timesheet approvals Available now in Wrike Labs, timesheet approvals was one of the most requested features from Wrikeâs professional services customers. Users get an all-in-one overview of their teamâs timesheets and can review, approve, and lock timesheets to prepare for monthly billing or payroll. Timesheet approvals is designed to drive time-tracking accountability and compliance by preventing unexpected changes and preserving data for accurate reporting and financial tracking. Dashboard templates for professional services teams Recently released dashboard templates help professional services teams quickly and easily visualize their data and project metrics so they can optimize performance based on multi-dimensional, real-time insights. New quick-start templates include utilization, client and project profitability, and team productivity reporting. ERP integrations To synchronize projects and accounting and streamline CSD workflows across multiple systems, Wrike is rolling out three new enterprise resource planning integrations, including Intuit QuickBooks, Oracle NetSuite, and Microsoft Dynamics 365. The Intuit QuickBooks integration, available now, simplifies the synchronization of time entries in Wrike with financial data in Intuit QuickBooks for invoicing and financial reporting. Additional ERP integrations help scale operations and ensure data accuracy by integrating Wrike with popular systems used by professional services teams. âThe powerful combination of these new features is a complete game changer for services providers,â continues Scott. âWrike helps teams smooth out the kinks in their workflows and eliminate friction, which will increase profits, free up resources for more impactful work, improve the client experience, accelerate time to value, and provide a competitive edge through efficiency.â Hear from our customers: âWrike improves our time to value and customer satisfaction by creating greater efficiency with the project manager, which makes them more effective with their customers.â â Neal McCoy, Senior Director Professional Services, BigCommerce âWe struggled to see capacity and forecast when we needed to bring in extra resources. Wrike has allowed us to manage the team in a very simplified way.â â G2 Crowd review âWith greater clarity, speed, and accountability in managing our projects, we can easily reallocate resources to work on different projects that are critical to the success of our organizations. Being able to optimize project time, we save on average ~20% per project. A significant cost reduction when multiplied by 50 projects each year.â â Kelly Maier, Project Manager, R&D and Continuous Innovation, Arvig âWeâve eliminated so many manual, paper tasks and processes with Wrike.â â Cassidy Pillow, Senior Manager, Client Services Operations, Granicus âThe ability to set up custom dashboards so that employees know what to work on that day, with tasks grouped into widgets customized for our processes and workflows keeps us running efficiently.â â G2 Crowd review For more information about Wrikeâs new features for client service delivery workflows, register for the Wrike Professional Services Power Series and download the âHow to Master the 3 Pillars of Professional Servicesâ eBook.
