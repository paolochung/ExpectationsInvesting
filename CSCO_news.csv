CSCO,2025-06-03 13:30:07,"These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-20250603.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points A &#8220;more is better&#8221; approach can help you diversify your portfolio while generating passive income. Five fascinating funds will tempt income seekers with potent yields and strong growth prospects. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Stock picking is fine, but exchange traded funds (ETFs) can enable immediate diversification without sacrificing growth and income opportunities. By selecting multiple funds instead of just one, you can achieve an extra measure of safety while also turning your portfolio into a veritable income-generating machine. The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/03/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-passive-income-machines/

GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, a 19% YoY improvement. Enterprise revenue rose 5.9% to $705 million, while Online revenue dipped 1.2% to $470 million — consistent with the ongoing shift toward larger, more durable contracts. Operating margins were strong across the board: GAAP operating margin hit 20.6%, while non-GAAP operating margin reached 39.8%. Customer momentum was solid, with 4,192 customers now contributing over $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue, up 8% YoY. However, net dollar expansion for enterprise accounts slipped to 98%, suggesting slower upsell activity. Zoom repurchased 5.6 million shares and ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in cash. Free cash flow was $463 million, down YoY, but still healthy. Guidance was slightly above expectations: Q2 revenue is projected at $1.195–$1.200 billion with EPS of $1.36–$1.37. FY26 revenue is guided to $4.80–$4.81 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $5.56–$5.59 — modestly higher than previous estimates. Past earnings reactions 3:44 pm Zoom’s earnings have been a model of consistency, but that consistency has done little to lift the stock. All four most recent quarters featured solid EPS beats — yet post-earnings movement has been largely neutral. To break this pattern, Zoom will need to show a shift in narrative: enterprise expansion, monetization of AI tools, or improving RPO. Absent that, even another beat may leave the stock treading water. Quarter EPS Actual EPS Est. Surprise Stock Reaction Q4 FY25 $1.41 $1.35 +5% Flat Q3 FY25 $1.38 $1.31 +6% Flat/–2% Q2 FY25 $1.39 $1.22 +14% Flat Q1 FY25 $1.35 $1.19 +13% Flat Zoom stock sentiment 3:33 pm Zoom’s short interest remains relatively low — around 2.2% of float — but options markets suggest growing skepticism into earnings. There has been notable put activity around the $75–$80 range, indicating some downside protection among long holders. The stock has traded in a tight band for months, and with little movement on strong EPS beats, traders appear to be bracing for a “good but not good enough” outcome. Analyst sentiment is neutral-to-cautious, and several firms have trimmed price targets in recent months without downgrading. The key setup: if Zoom misses or guides weak, there’s room for downside. But if it delivers upside and hints at AI revenue traction, low short interest could limit the intensity of any selloff. Steady Execution 2:37 pm Zoom’s last earnings call was all about balance: management emphasized durable enterprise growth while acknowledging ongoing pressure in the online/SMB segment. CEO Eric Yuan spoke at length about Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center as long-term growth engines, but didn’t provide revenue breakouts or attach metrics for either. The tone was calm, consistent, and arguably too cautious. Analysts pressed the company for clarity on AI monetization through its Zoom AI Companion rollout, but received only directional answers. CFO Kelly Steckelberg reaffirmed guidance but flagged slower renewals in EMEA and higher competition in the public sector. This quarter, Zoom needs to show that AI tools aren’t just a product enhancement but a revenue driver. Investors also want more segmentation of growth — especially between the enterprise and online business lines. What to watch this quarter: Revenue contribution or attach rate updates from AI tools Net expansion trends across enterprise accounts Specific metrics around Zoom Phone/Contact Center growth Any signal of stabilization in churned regions AI Tools and Enterprise Momentum Must Start Driving Numbers 1:28 pm Zoom’s product roadmap continues to evolve, with the company pushing hard into AI-driven enhancements through its AI Companion tools, as well as deeper investments in Contact Center and Zoom Phone. But these offerings have yet to move the needle meaningfully on top-line growth. On last quarter’s call, management flagged strong enterprise adoption but admitted that online customer churn remained a drag. Gross margin was stable above 78%, but free cash flow dipped, and revenue growth slowed to just 2% YoY. This quarter, investors want to see if enterprise net expansion is holding and whether AI products are leading to measurable upsell. Any shift in RPO trajectory or commentary on upsell momentum will be closely dissected. Watch for: Growth in Zoom Phone or Contact Center revenue RPO and deferred revenue trends AI Companion monetization signals Margin stability and cash flow commentary Earnings Must Clarify Whether Growth Has Truly Bottomed 12:28 pm Zoom’s macro challenge is no secret — the pandemic boom is long over, and the company now competes in a price-sensitive, saturated UCaaS market. While management has leaned into new verticals like Zoom Phone and AI Companion tools, those segments remain too small to drive top-line acceleration on their own. The last four earnings reports have all beaten EPS expectations, yet the stock reaction has been minimal. Why? Because Zoom hasn’t been able to show a compelling growth reacceleration or defend market share against bundled platforms like Microsoft Teams. Heading into this print, investors will want updates on enterprise net retention, contribution from Contact Center, and whether AI features are leading to actual monetization. Flat or declining RPO could signal continued stagnation — while even a modest uptick might spark renewed interest if paired with margin stability. Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) reports earnings after the market closes today, with Wall Street looking for signs of steady enterprise traction in what’s become an increasingly saturated unified communications market. The company is expected to post EPS of $1.31 on $1.17 billion in revenue — both modestly lower than year-ago levels and roughly in line with recent trends. The broader setup: low expectations, high execution consistency, and a stock that’s moved mostly sideways in 2025. Over the past year, Zoom has quietly posted four consecutive earnings beats, but those surprises haven’t sparked meaningful stock upside. That reflects investor skepticism that core revenue streams — especially the legacy online video product — can drive meaningful growth without significant margin trade-offs. While management has pushed into new verticals like Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center, adoption rates remain slow, and pricing pressure continues to weigh on visibility. One area that could shift sentiment is AI. The company has touted AI Companion and other intelligent collaboration features, but these haven’t yet generated material monetization. That puts extra pressure on today’s earnings call to clarify go-to-market traction and attach rates for AI-enhanced services. Zoom’s full-year FY26 EPS is forecast at $5.37, slightly below last year’s $5.54, which tells the story: this is a stable, cash-generating company still trying to find its next growth gear. With competitors like Microsoft Teams bundling aggressively, and RingCentral and Cisco investing in UCaaS integrations, Zoom’s positioning is increasingly a margin defense game — not a top-line expansion story. Analysts will be focused on enterprise churn rates, gross margin mix, and any acceleration in RPO as potential green shoots. After several quarters of holding steady, the question for Zoom isn’t “will they deliver?” — it’s whether delivering is enough.

Dimon pointed to the unpredictable nature of tariffs as a key area of uncertainty, while the bank’s chief U.S. economist has attached a less than 50% chance of a recession. Dimon told Bloomberg, &#8220;If there’s a recession, I don’t know how big it will be or how long it will last. Hopefully we’ll avoid it, but I wouldn’t take it off the table at this point.&#8221; Shielding Consumers 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo While some retailers like Walmart are discussing higher prices for consumers due to tariffs, data on producer prices suggests a broader trend of cost absorption. April saw a significant 0.5% decrease in producer prices, the most substantial drop in five years. This indicates that U.S. producers are largely bearing the brunt of increased costs, protecting consumers from immediate price hikes, a finding that significantly undershot Bloomberg economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The stock market has opened with a cautious tone this morning, as the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500 are all trading lower. The SPX index is down 0.37%. Investors are reacting to concerning statements made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at an economic forum earlier today. Powell warned of potentially higher long-term interest rates for the long term, owing in part to an uncertain monetary policy outlook. Today&#8217;s pullback follows an impressive run for the broader stock market in which the S&amp;P 500 has been retaking lost ground for a positive year-to-date performance. For its part, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has recovered 6% over the past five trading sessions. Today Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) will distribute it quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share to shareholders. Here&#8217;s the early look at market performance: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 114.29 (-0.27%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 128.16 (-0.67%) S&amp;P 500: Down 13.30 (-0.23%) Stocks in Focus Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is trading down by 4.0% following an announcement from a company executive that the retailer plans to transfer tariff costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, with these increases potentially taking effect this month. Shares of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) have tumbled by 6.5% today after the company reported disappointing revenue figures for its fiscal fourth quarter. Networking solutions provider Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) is also seeing downward pressure, with its stock down 4.2%. CoreWeave (Nasdaq: CRWV) is under pressure, falling by 4.4%, despite announcing strong first-quarter revenue and significant demand for its AI cloud platform,. Investors appear concerned by the company&#8217;s plans for aggressive capex plans in Q2. On the positive side, CoreWeave clinched a lucrative partnership with Google. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is a major drag on the markets, falling 17% today in a series of setbacks, the latest of which is a potential Medicare controversy.

Share price spiking after release 4:10 pm Cisco is trading at $63.39 after earnings. Guidance for the next quarter and full year: Guidance Q4 FY2025 Revenue: $14.5B – $14.7B GAAP EPS: $0.62 – $0.67 Non-GAAP EPS: $0.96 – $0.98 Full-Year FY2025 Revenue: $56.5B – $56.7B GAAP EPS: $2.53 – $2.58 Non-GAAP EPS: $3.77 – $3.79 Cisco Earnings Are Out 4:08 pm Cisco delivered a robust $14.1 billion in revenue, marking an 11% year-over-year increase, and coming in above the high end of guidance. This strength was broad-based across geographies and customer segments. Product orders rose 20% YoY, or 9% excluding Splunk, signaling strong end-market demand. AI infrastructure orders from webscale customers topped $600 million, helping Cisco hit its $1 billion AI order goal a full quarter early. Metric Q3 FY2025 Q3 FY2024 YoY Change Revenue $14.1B $12.7B +11% GAAP EPS $0.62 $0.46 +35% Non-GAAP EPS $0.96 $0.88 +9% GAAP Net Income $2.5B $1.9B +32% Non-GAAP Net Income $3.8B $3.6B +8% Margins also impressed: GAAP gross margin: 65.6% | Non-GAAP: 68.6% GAAP operating margin: 22.6% | Non-GAAP: 34.5% Segment Performance Americas: +14% YoY EMEA: +8% APJC: +9% By product line: Security: +54% Observability: +24% Networking: +8% Collaboration: +4% ash &amp; Shareholder Returns Operating cash flow: $4.1B (+2% YoY) Cash/investments on hand: $15.6B Returned to shareholders: $3.1B (via dividends and buybacks) Quarterly dividend: Maintained at $0.41/share, payable July 23 Segment breakdown 3:18 pm Cisco’s business is increasingly anchored in recurring revenue, with software and services making up over 40% of total sales. Key segments to watch: Secure, Agile Networks: Still the largest contributor, driven by enterprise hardware refresh cycles Security &amp; Observability (Splunk): Now critical to margin expansion and recurring ARR Internet for the Future: Telco and data center routing — weaker in past quarters, sensitive to macro budgets If Splunk growth accelerates or services outpace hardware, the market could reward Cisco with multiple expansion. Cisco and Splunk convergence 2:10 pm Previously, Cisco’s leadership has emphasized Splunk’s integration as a long-term driver of security + observability convergence — but many analysts have yet to bake in meaningful top-line synergy. “We see Splunk transforming our software portfolio — not just as a bolt-on, but a catalyst across secure networking.” If Cisco signals early cross-sell traction or faster ARR onboarding than expected, this could reshape near-term margin and software revenue expectations. Cisco Shares Dropping Today 1:31 pm by Joel South Cisco shares are dropping today before their third-quarter earnings. There&#8217;s no notable news on the company, but shares are down 1.24%. Competitors like Ciena (NYSE: CIEN) are also seeing weakness today, so this could be some sector-related negativity leading to investors rotating out of networking stocks. Consensus Check 10:28 am Cisco is expected to report Q3 FY25 EPS of $0.92 and revenue of $14.05 billion, squarely within company guidance of $13.9B–$14.1B. That reflects flat to modest top-line growth, with consensus focused on stability over acceleration. The Street is largely looking for: Continued strength in enterprise networking Signs of integration progress post-Splunk acquisition Growth in AI-related orders (previous quarter: $350M AI bookings) Cisco has beaten earnings estimates for four straight quarters, but revenue beats have been modest. For the stock to move higher, investors may need an uptick in FY guidance or an AI-specific revenue breakout. Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) reports Q3 FY2025 results this evening, with Wall Street expecting EPS of $0.92 on revenue of $14.05 billion, near the top end of company guidance. The stock has traded flat year to date and is looking for a catalyst as enterprise and government networking spend remains uneven. Key themes to watch tonight include how much traction Cisco is seeing in AI-related infrastructure demand, as it competes with hyperscalers and vertical integrators. Orders for AI networking surpassed $350 million last quarter, and commentary around growth in that line will be critical. Also in focus is the early performance of Splunk, the $28 billion acquisition aimed at boosting Cisco’s cloud-native and security footprint. Investors will also want clarity on macro demand signals across enterprise, cloud, and service provider segments. Gross margins held firm last quarter, but hardware mix and FX remain swing factors. Cisco has beaten EPS estimates in four straight quarters, including a 14% beat a year ago. With the bar set around top-line stabilization and forward guidance, anything short of a modest raise could weigh on sentiment.

The Street's mean price target suggests more than 10% upside.Revenue and adjusted earnings are both expected to have improved year-over-year. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is slated to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market closes Wednesday, with earnings and revenue expected to tick up somewhat from a year earlier. Analysts on average expect Cisco to report quarterly revenue of $14.06 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year, and adjusted net income of $3.66 billion, or 92 cents per share, up from $3.55 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Of the 10 analysts following Cisco who are tracked by Visible Alpha, three have a “buy” rating for the networking-equipment provider’s stock, and seven maintain “hold” ratings. Their consensus price target near $67 would suggest 12% upside from the stock’s closing price Friday. Shares of Cisco have gained about 2% in 2025. Analysts will also be watching Cisco’s artificial intelligence infrastructure orders. In February, the company said second-quarter AI orders exceeded $350 million, bringing its total to roughly $700 million for the first half of the fiscal year. Analysts could also ask Cisco about the quantum computing chip it unveiled last week, which the company claims “could accelerate impactful quantum computing and networking applications from decades away to just 5-10 years.” Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk. Sit back and let dividends do the heavy lifting for a simple, steady path to serious wealth creation over time. Grab a free copy of “2 Legendary High-Yield Dividend Stocks“ now. Dividend-paying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enhance these benefits by pooling dozens or hundreds of such stocks, offering instant diversification, reduced single-stock risk, and low expense ratios. In 2025’s uncertain market, marked by tariffs and persistent inflation, dividend ETFs provide resilience and income stability. Pursuing this strategy ensures steady returns and growth, making it ideal for both novice and seasoned investors seeking financial security. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Any discussion of dividend ETFs must begin with Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). It is a top-tier dividend ETF, tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index with around 100 high-quality stocks like Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), each boasting more than 10 years of dividend growth. The ETF&#8217;s 3.7% yield and ultra-low 0.06% expense ratio make it cost-effective while limiting sector exposure to no more than 25% ensures diversification. SCHD’s 11.4% annualized return over a decade reflects its balance of income and growth. Because SCHD focuses on financially sound companies, the dividend ETF mitigates risks, offering investors stability. For those seeking high yield and reliability, SCHD stock is a must-own ETF for lifelong passive income. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE:VYM) tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, holding 589 stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), with no stock exceeding 4% of the portfolio. VYM&#8217;s 2.7% yield and 0.06% expense ratio deliver strong value, while its 13.3% five-year annualized return highlights its consistency. VYM also offers broad diversification across sectors like energy and financials, reducing volatility, making it ideal for conservative investors. With tariff&#8217;s top-of-mind for investors these days, the ETF&#8217;s U.S.-focused holdings provide resilience against global disruptions. Its proven track record and low costs makes VYM a foundational ETF for steady dividend income and long-term wealth building. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG) targets companies with over 10 years of dividend increases, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and holds 338 stocks in its portfolio. The ETF&#8217;s 1.8% yield is lower, but its focus on dividend growth drives an 11.2% annualized return over the past decade. VIG&#8217;s 0.05% expense ratio is also among the lowest, maximizing investor returns. The Vanguard dividend ETF’s tech- and consumer-heavy portfolio suits investors prioritizing capital appreciation alongside income. And for investors looking for exposure to stable, growing firms, VIG cushions against economic uncertainty. It&#8217;s another ETF sporting a blend of growth and income, making it a versatile choice for investors seeking a balance of dividends and upside potential. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO) The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:DGRO) tracks the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, holding over 400 stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and emphasizes its consistent dividend growth. DGRO sports a 2.3% yield and 0.08% expense ratio, offering a balanced income stream and a 16.4% annualized return over five years. The ETF&#8217;s diversified sector exposure, including financials and healthcare, minimizes risk. In today&#8217;s volatile market, the ETF&#8217;s focus on resilient, dividend-growing companies counters the extreme swings the market is experiencing. DGRO’s low cost and steady performance make it an excellent choice for investors seeking dependable income with moderate growth in a challenging economic landscape. ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) The last dividend ETF to consider is ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEARCA:NOBL), which tracks the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. It holds over 60 stocks, each with over 25 years of dividend increases, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW). With a 2.5% yield and 0.35% expense ratio, it reflects NOBL&#8217;s premium quality, which has generated 14.5% annualized returns over the last five years. The ETF&#8217;s equal-weighted approach also reduces concentration risk, while its focus on elite dividend payers ensures stability. NOBL’s defensive holdings, with a long history of thriving amid uncertainty, offer investors reliable payouts. For those prioritizing quality and consistency, NOBL’s proven resilience makes it a stellar long-term holding for passive income.
