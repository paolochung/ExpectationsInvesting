TSLA,2025-06-09 14:03:19,Will Trump “Consequences” Break Tesla?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/will-trump-consequences-break-tesla-20250609.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"President Donald Trump says Elon Musk will face “very serious consequences” if he provides financial backing to Democrats who challenge Republicans who support the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The bill includes the President&#8217;s national budget and other government policies that he has created and supported. Key Points Elon Musk May Back Candidates That Are Democrats Trump Could Take Revenge On Tesla Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A plan to back Democrats would likely mean Musk would fund their campaigns in elections that pit them against Republicans in House and Senate races next year. Musk supported Republicans in the same way in the 2024 election. What Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) investors should fear is that Trump will attack America’s largest EV company. Trump might also financially damage SpaceX, the huge rocket company that has billions of dollars in federal government contracts. Tesla has several connections to the federal government, which some Trump officials might target. Among the primary ones is almost certainly dropping the $7,500 tax break for people who buy most electric vehicles (EVs). That move was certainly months ago and is likely priced into Tesla’s shares today. Tesla may be affected by China tariffs that add 25% to goods imported from China. Those tariffs are currently on hold, but if they take effect, they will impact parts and batteries that Tesla needs in the U.S. to manufacture its vehicles. As is true with other car companies, Tesla would need to accept lower margins or pass the costs on to customers. It is too early to tell if the potential higher prices would affect demand for Teslas. Tesla might have to raise prices by hundreds or thousands of dollars to protect its operating income. Rules for full self-driving cars are set by cities and states today. There has always been a chance that this would be moved to the federal government level. It is the only way to have standard rules across the entire country. Tesla’s self-driving technology differs from that of competitors, such as Alphabet&#8217;s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Waymo. Rules unfavorable to Tesla’s products could allow its competition to advance plans to install them widely in cars. The SEC has investigated Musk before. For example, Musk tweeted in 2018 that Tesla would go private at a share price much higher than it was at that point. The SEC called the tweet “false and misleading.” In May 2024, according to Reuters, “Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems assist with steering, braking and lane changes &#8211; but are not fully autonomous. While Tesla has warned drivers to stay ready to take over driving, the Justice Department is examining other statements by Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk suggesting its cars can drive themselves.” There is also a theory that the government could probe Musk’s drug use, which many media outlets have described. Tesla has often been described as a risky investment. That risk has grown.

TSLA,2025-06-09 14:03:19,"Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Bull, Base, & Bear Price Prediction and Forecast",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/tesla-nasdaq-tsla-bull-base-bear-price-prediction-and-20250609.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) lost 14.11% over the past five days as the fall-out between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump continues. After rebounding 63.57% from its year-to-date low on April 8 through May 27, the stock is down 18.67%. Last Monday, reports of the company&#8217;s sales in Europe continuing to collapse made the rounds, further fueling the sell-off. Since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, 2024, TSLA has lost nearly 38.49%. In early May, it was reported that Tesla has around $800 million worth of Cybertrucks stuck on lots. It was also reported this month that, in addition to collapsing sales in Europe broadly, Tesla has seen sales in Sweden plunges 80.7%. In April, it was reported that Tesla now accounts for fewer than 50% of EV sales in California. After absorbing enormous losses, Elon Musk&#8217;s EV empire fell outside of the $1 trillion club, but as of May 19, the company&#8217;s market cap stands at $1.09 trillion. Nonetheless, questions linger as to whether the company&#8217;s most ambitious of growth drivers (think Cybercab and Optimus humanoid robot, both of which were featured at the company&#8217;s robotaxi event last year) will bear fruit sooner rather than later. Indeed, Tesla&#8217;s stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk&#8217;s role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk&#8217;s friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla&#8217;s outlook remains clouded. In any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let&#8217;s check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it&#8217;s a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term. Key Points in This Article: Tesla remains the leader of the EV revolution, dominating global market share despite the stock&#8217;s recent struggles. The company faces numerous headwinds, which could ultimately impact its long-term performance.

The report includes a complete industry map of AI investments that includes many small caps. Tesla&#8217;s Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along For a stock that&#8217;s fallen significantly, I&#8217;d expect the growth narrative to have been severely impacted. Tesla&#8217;s latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla&#8217;s most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully. Undoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it&#8217;s one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas&#8217; view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied &#8220;AI ETF&#8221; given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes. Though Tesla&#8217;s AI efforts are exciting, it&#8217;s important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it&#8217;s to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla&#8217;s been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories? The most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there&#8217;s also the rumored &#8220;Model Q&#8221; entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a &#8220;wild card.&#8221; Bull Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price Cybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla&#8217;s robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk&#8217;s vision of the robotaxi future could be a reality within Trump&#8217;s term. Of course, a more realistic timeframe would put such a future more than 10 years out. However, if Tesla can floor it on full self-driving (FSD) efforts, perhaps such a future could be closer to the present. There&#8217;s a great deal of uncertainty with FSD, given the technical and regulatory unknowns. Either way, I view Musk&#8217;s friendship with Trump as a boon for a Cybertruck rollout under his administration. If Cybertruck expands its presence and becomes a hit within years rather than decades, TSLA stock could prove a bargain, given all that there is to gain. The big question, though, is how Cybercab will hold its own as Waymo pushes ahead with its impressive offering. Given robotaxis, like generative AI, are unlikely to be a &#8220;winner takes all&#8221; market, I think there&#8217;s no reason why both robotaxi offerings can&#8217;t win big from prime-time adoption of self-driving. Another big question to consider is whether consumers will be interested in buying up Cybercabs to have them rolling around on the streets as ride-hailers. I think the business could prove quite lucrative for buyers and Tesla&#8217;s margins over the long haul. After all, it can sell the car and continue to build a ride-hailing network while profiting from use of a ride-hailing app of sorts. Cathie Wood thinks autonomous ride-hailing could represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. If Tesla can get a nice slice, Wood sees TSLA stock at $2,600 per share by 2029. Personally, I think the bull case (for the year ahead) could see TSLA at around $550 per share — or 86.35% higher than where the stock is trading today. That target is shared by Wedbush Securities&#8217; Dan Ives, one of my favorite analysts in tech. Optimus: Optimus was a nice addition to the robotaxis event as it amused attendees. But the big question is how much potential the robot has once it&#8217;s ready to go on sale to the general public. Undoubtedly, Tesla isn&#8217;t the only one getting into the robotics game. Many Mag Seven members also investing heavily in home robots. While more rivals in home robots could be a threat to Optimus, I view it as more of a confirmation that there is a place in the home for such profound innovations. As for the home robotics market, I do see 2026 as a tad overly optimistic for a launch. However, if robot &#8220;friends&#8221; do arrive by 2030, I think Tesla&#8217;s growth rate could reaccelerate back to or even above 25% to 30% for some amount of time. Bear Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price Cybertruck: Undoubtedly, there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do before Cybertruck makes an impact on the car market. FSD capabilities need to step things up and the vehicle needs to be made in a way that won&#8217;t break the bank. These are big asks. Some bears have doubts about whether the firm can execute the opportunity. In late March, the company announced that it was recalling nearly every Cybertruck due to a potential crash risk. This was an enormous blow to Musk&#8217;s ambitions for the EV, which has already been subjected to harsh criticism about its perceived shortcomings among owners. Analysts&#8217; Downgrades: Ross Gerber, who previously owned shares, has sold out with the view a 50% crash would be in store for 2025. He also thinks FSD &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221; If true, that&#8217;s a gut punch to Tesla&#8217;s biggest growth driver. Either way, there&#8217;s not too much room lower with TSLA now off 40%. With Guggenheim labeling TSLA stock as a &#8220;Sell&#8221; with a $175 target, I&#8217;d brace for even more pain if the market sell-off intensifies. That price target represents additional downside potential of 40.70% from today&#8217;s share price. On June 9, Argus downgraded Tesla to &#8220;Hold&#8221; from &#8220;Buy,&#8221; stating that the stock appears to currently be trading on non-fundamental events, specifically the worsening tiff between Trump and Musk. Bad Press: Musk&#8217;s deteriorated image at the hands of his federal government involvement with DOGE aside, Tesla has continued to bear the brunt of bad news. In late 2024, it was widely reported that the EV maker was the most dangerous vehicle brand, with the number of deaths among all automakers, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. According to the study, Tesla has a fatal accident rate of 5.6 per billion vehicle miles, compared to the overall average of just 2.8. Additionally, ongoing protests against the brand — including vandalism and arson — have occurred around the globe, from Italy and France to numerous states in the U.S. Optimus: Even if home robots are on the horizon, good luck asking consumers to spend thousands on a proven technology. Indeed, if Vision Pro taught us anything, it&#8217;s that being an early adopter is expensive and probably not the best use of funds. Either way, I&#8217;d much rather wait and see how the robot ambitions pan out before getting too excited at this stage. Insider &amp; Institutional Activity: There&#8217;s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests investors should &#8220;follow the money.&#8221; If that&#8217;s the current case for Tesla, money is flowing out. In fact, over the past 12 years, no one single share of TSLA has been purchased by insiders (e.g., the company&#8217;s executives, directors or anyone who owns 10% or more of the company), according to Nasdaq.com. Data from Finviz supports this, even showing that Musk himself, as well as his brother, have been offloading shares since late 2024. Additionally, institutional ownership has now decreased to just 48.77%. In total, 480 institutional investors have entirely liquidated their Tesla positions, with 1,897 institutional holders having decreased their positions versus 2,018 having increased them. Price Targets: In April, Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on Tesla to $260 from $275 while maintaining a neutral rating. The firm reduced its auto industry outlook and estimates, saying it will be difficult for the auto industry to fully pass on tariff costs, especially given softening consumer demand. Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs&#8217; one-year price target represents downside potential of 11.90% from today&#8217;s price. Increased competition: Also in April, a Jeff Bezos-backed EV company called Slate unveiled affordable EV truck and SUV models that cost $20,000 after federal incentives. The company has billed itself as the &#8220;anti-Tesla,&#8221; and is made in the U.S. As Tesla&#8217;s market share has fallen under 50% in EV-friendly California, the arrival of Slate could continue to erode sales. Base Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price The base case for Tesla lies somewhere in between the two extremes. Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $281.77, or 4.53% potential downside from today&#8217;s price. Meanwhile, the high-end target is $500 and the low-end target is $19.05. I&#8217;m inclined to view the $300 level as a fair-value level for the stock. Much of Tesla&#8217;s story depends on its big growth drivers. In the meantime, EV sales and the rise of more affordable models (Model Q) could be nearer-term stories to look forward to as one waits for the biggest of drivers to pay off. At the time of writing, TSLA stock goes for 140.85 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 8.28 times froward price-to-sales (P/S). That makes the name slightly undervalued, at least in my view.

Yesterday alone, his net worth lost $35 billion. Much of this was triggered by a decline in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock, which was down 17% after the battle began. It closed off 14% on Thursday, which lowered its market cap to $917 billion. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: A bitter flare-up with President Trump has helped reduce Elon Musk’s net worth by $98 billion. Musk remains the world&#8217;s richest man, for now. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The quarrel with the U.S. president may have several side effects, although it is not clear if Trump and Musk will continue to press some of their threats. The president mentioned cuts to the tax breaks for electric vehicle (EV) buyers. Those were already in the works and likely built into Tesla’s stock price. The president could ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to start investigations into Tesla’s alleged blind eye toward Musk’s drug use. Trump could also try to block approval of Tesla’s self-driving car features, which have already been undermined by several Tesla crashes. Much of Tesla’s market cap relies on the success of this feature. As far as current investors are concerned, the market cap of the EV company sits at number 11 among all public companies. This market cap was above $1 trillion at the start of the year. Musk owns 13% of Tesla’s shares outstanding. It&#8217;s More Than Just Tesla President Trump also threatened to cancel the U.S. government’s relationship with rocket company SpaceX. The fight between the two men threatens $22 billion of SpaceX contracts. The most recent valuation of the private company was $400 billion. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX and has 79% of the voting shares. The value of SpaceX includes satellite internet company Starlink. It provides internet service to over 100 nations. Starlink’s service works via over 7,500 satellites, a number which is growing. The company plans to push that to 40,000. Trump could attempt to block the use of Starlink internet service in the United States. Whether he can be successful is another matter. Musk also owns xAI, which is a marriage of social media company X and the xAI artificial intelligence company. The value of this new company has been put as high as $113 billion. Musk owns 58% of the combined operation. It may eventually seek government contracts for its AI services. Musk remains the richest man in the world at $335 billion. The future of his feud with President Trump could reduce that further.

Wall Street Bullish on This Big Tech Stock 9:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts have turned increasingly bullish on Amazon stock. Here&#8217;s a roundup of the most recent analyst moves: Earlier this week, BofA reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN and raised its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts highlighted Amazon’s advancements in robotics and AI, noting these could add approximately 2 percentage points to retail margins, supporting further upside. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating and increased its price target from $225 to $240. The firm emphasized Amazon’s leadership in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), along with margin tailwinds and a strong free cash flow (FCF) ramp, fueling a bullish long-term outlook. Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $240, noting that delays in Amazon’s Project Kuiper (satellite internet initiative) are expected and priced into the stock. They expressed confidence in Amazon’s 2025 launch cadence and cost guidance for the project. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain fickle, but today there is reason to be optimistic. Discussions have reemerged between the White House and Beijing, according to Chinese media reports. This has revived the &#8216;risk-on&#8217; trade and sent major stock market indices higher across the board. In a last-ditch effort, officials from both sides are trying to salvage trade talks that had previously stalled. Sectors of the economy are mixed today, with no clear conviction in either direction. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been capturing attention lately, most recently for announcing a $10 billion bet on AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock is up 1.7% today. Additionally, the markets are keeping an eye on the broader S&amp;P 500 index, which will announce changes to its member lineup on Friday. Bank of America has offered its two cents, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) could muscle their way into the index.

Separately, Bank of America analysts reemphasized NVDA stock as one of their top picks with a $180 price objective, saying it&#8217;s in the best spot to capture the benefits of the &#8220;AI tide.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is losing close to 5% today after Elon Musk turned his attention to the U.S. tax bill. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) will release its quarterly results after the closing bell today. The stock is trading slightly lower this morning.

Wall Street Bullish on Big Tech 10:17 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts are showing growing optimism regarding Amazon stock. Below is a summary of the latest analyst actions: Earlier this week, BofA reconfirmed its Buy rating for Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), elevating its price target from $230 to $248.

They conveyed confidence in Amazon&#8217;s 2025 launch schedule and cost projections for the initiative. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain unpredictable, and today is no exception. After starting out of the gate higher on trade talk hopes, stocks have since erased those gains. According to Chinese state media, talks have resumed between the White House and Beijing. In a final push, officials from both nations are attempting to rescue stalled trade negotiations. This appeared to have reignited the &#8220;risk-on&#8221; sentiment, but the markets have since taken a nosedive. Economic sectors are showing mixed signals today, lacking a decisive direction.

A Chinese automaker, Changan, has just announced plans to introduce a vehicle with a solid-state battery. This new car offers an unprecedented 932-mile range on just one charge. This remarkable achievement in battery technology could reshape the EV market worldwide, challenging companies like Tesla. This new “miracle battery” car would offer a solution to concerns from would-be EV customers about range limitations and accessibility of charging stations. Changan will release the model in 2027 and may soon become a highly recognizable name. 24/7 Wall St. Insights The quality of Chinese electric vehicles could threaten Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and other American automakers. For now, tariffs keep them out of the U.S. market. Also: Dividend legends to hold forever. Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), such as those made by Changan, could threaten Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) sales in the United States and badly damage the EV plans of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) and General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM). For now, 100% tariffs keep them out of the American market, which is important because many carry price tags well under $20,000. Another question is whether Chinese EVs are built at quality levels that would match U.S. car buyer expectations. Chinese car companies might be able to enter the U.S. market because they produce vehicles in Mexico. For now, no decision has been made about whether they could be sold in the United States because of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It created a trade zone among Mexico, Canada, and the United States. It keeps tariffs among the nations low but does not eliminate them. This post was updated on June 2, 2025 to include information about China&#8217;s newly announced EV. How Good Are Chinese EVs? Could Chinese EVs battle for U.S. market share? MotorTrend, the car publication, went to China to test several EVs. The primary reason was to see how these vehicles would perform if sold in the United States. In some cases, they were compared to similar vehicles made in or assembled in America. While some cars, SUVs, and light trucks MotorTrend tested are not designed or built well enough for the United States, many could sell in America with minor modifications. Another conclusion was that several had direct rival models in the United States, so there would be a battle for market share. In some cases, the Chinese EV was better than anything sold in the United States. One example was the iCar 03. The MotorTrend editors wrote: Unanimously the favorite vehicle our editors drove in China, the plucky little 03 electric off-roader from iCar is the first vehicle from Chery’s new subbrand. About the same size as a Ford Bronco Sport, the iCar 03 blends Bronco, Suzuki Jimny, and Land Rover Defender styling cues into a delightfully well-packaged SUV. Ford and Land Rover are major brands with substantial U.S. sales. Other tests showed that Chinese cars could rival some Tesla products. Tariffs could keep Chinese vehicles out of the United States indefinitely. However, if those tariffs ever drop, several vehicles sold in America will have trouble protecting their market shares.

TSLA,2025-06-03 13:30:07,Wall Street Price Prediction: Tesla’s Share Price Forecast for 2025,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/wall-street-price-prediction-teslas-share-price-forecast-for-20250603.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"After soaring in 2023 and 2024, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was battered throughout Q1 2025. But since the start of Q2, the largest U.S. EV-maker has seen its shares bounce back nicely. After falling by 41.50% through April 8, the stock has since gained nearly 58% from its year-to-date low, including a gain of nearly 25% over the past month. Still, numerous headwinds remain for the Elon Musk-led company, which reported abysmal Q1 earnings. Tesla has suffered incredible losses that have shocked shareholders who had grown accustomed to the stock&#8217;s rapid appreciation over the past decade. The company&#8217;s meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That&#8217;s certainly a move that&#8217;s come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it&#8217;s clear that Musk&#8217;s visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla&#8217;s IPO on June 29, 2010. Goldman Sachs recently lowered its price target again for Tesla to $235 from $260, noting that it will be difficult for the auto industry to fully pass on tariff costs, especially with softening consumer demand. That estimate is good for nearly 33% potential downside from the current share price. But as the company continues to see sales decline in the U.S. and abroad, investors are hoping that the recently announced 90-day tariff pause between the U.S. and China sparks market optimism, affording shares of TSLA the opportunity to recover from has been a difficult 2025. With Musk announcing he be vacating his federal government role with DOGE to focus on Tesla, the stock has been performing better of late. 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let&#8217;s dive into whether the recent drop in Tesla’s stock price can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher. Key Points About This Article: Tesla has been among the key beneficiaries of a new Trump administration, though much of the benefits investors saw into the end of last year have since dissipated. Let&#8217;s dive into where the largest U.S. EV maker could be headed over the course of the next year. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our brand-new “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. Key Drivers of Tesla&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Core EV Business: Tesla&#8217;s most important business line is unsurprisingly the company&#8217;s auto business. With sales of the company&#8217;s EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company&#8217;s future prospects in proportion to how the company&#8217;s core revenue and earnings driver is performing. 2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla&#8217;s value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company&#8217;s core electric vehicle offering, Tesla&#8217;s energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen. 3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that&#8217;s been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump&#8217;s election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We&#8217;ll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come. What Wall Street Thinks Tesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. Analyst price targets span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $19.05 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $500 per share. Thus, there&#8217;s not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems. It&#8217;s worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though. However, given how far Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it&#8217;ll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it&#8217;s best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one&#8217;s own DCF analysis on and coming to one&#8217;s own price target. Tesla&#8217;s 2025 Outlook As we move through 2025, analyst opinions on where Tesla could be headed do vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Analysts project a 17.5% revenue increase to $117.2 billion, driven by growing demand and energy sector expansion. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below Bloomberg’s consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla’s earlier estimates. Despite a 62.5% stock surge in 2024, an $80 billion market value drop raised concerns. CEO Elon Musk remains optimistic, expecting a 20-30% delivery increase, though management later emphasized a &#8220;return to growth.&#8221; To add, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France, and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer, but the company recently saw its share of the EV market slip below 50% in California. Tesla Stock 2025 Price Target Based on Wall Street analysts&#8217; estimates, the median one-year price target for shares of TSLA is $282.70, which implies 19.16% potential downside from its current price. Of the 37 analysts covering Tesla, the stock currently receives a consensus “Hold” rating, with 16 analysts rating it a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; 10 rating it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and 11 rating it a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; On the other hand, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month price target for Tesla is bullish at $352.99, which represents potential upside of 0.92% from the current share price. Those figures are based on the company seeing projected revenue growth climb from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030.

Tesla shares this year have been under pressure this year from investor concerns that Musk was distracted from running the company as well as falling European and China sales. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said he is ending his role in the Trump administration running cost-cutting entity DOGE, just days after he announced plans to refocus his attention on the EV maker. “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” Musk posted on his X social media platform. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” Musk’s role running the department tasked with reducing the size of the federal workforce has weighed on Tesla stock amid investors’ perception that the CEO was distracted from running the EV maker. Tesla shares this year have also been under pressure from falling European and China sales. Tesla shares are rising 2.5% in premarket trading Thursday as tech shares gain following a federal trade court ruling that President Donald Trump didn’t have the authority to impose tariffs. The shares remain down more than 10% so far this year through Wednesday. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

TSLA,2025-05-29 09:42:49,5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens on Thursday,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-on-20250529.jpg,https://www.investopedia.com,"Close U.S. stock futures are pointing sharply higher after a federal court struck down President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are jumping in premarket trading after the chipmaker posted record revenue that tops analysts' estimates; Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk says he has ended his government work; and Salesforce (CRM) reports better-than-expected results and lifts its full-year outlook. Here's what investors need to know today. 1. US Stock Futures Rise Following Court Ruling on Tariffs U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after a U.S. court ruling struck down President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs and Nvidia posted record revenue. Nasdaq futures are 1.4% higher after the tech-focused index slipped by 0.5% in the prior session as stocks fell ahead of Nvidia's earnings report. S&P 500 futures are up about 1% in early trading while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.4% higher. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade near $109,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is up at around 4.51%. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are little changed. 2. Federal Court Strikes Down Trump's 'Reciprocal' Tariffs A federal court late Wednesday struck down the ""reciprocal"" tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on the country's trading partners in early April, saying he had overstepped his authority. A three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Congress is typically responsible for imposing these levies and not the president alone. The ruling stopped Trump from enforcing the tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China that were aimed at combating fentanyl entering the U.S. The steel and aluminum tariffs Trump imposed in March weren't mentioned in the ruling. The White House immediately appealed the ruling, per reports. 3. Nvidia Stock Jumps on Soaring Revenue Despite Chip Restrictions Nvidia (NVDA) shares are jumping 6% in premarket trading after the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue rose to a record high, even as profit missed analysts' expectations because of export curbs. Nvidia reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share on revenue that jumped 69% year-over-year to $44.06 billion. While its quarterly sales exceeded analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, its profit did not, as Nvidia said it absorbed a $4.5 billion charge due to restrictions on the sale of its H20 chips to China. In the current quarter, Nvidia expects to take an $8 billion hit due to lost revenue from H20 sales. 4. Tesla CEO Musk Announces End to Government Role Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said in a post on his social media site X that his time at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ended. The announcement comes after he said earlier this week that he would return to ""spending 24/7 at work"" after investors had raised questions over whether the government position was distracting his focus from Tesla and his other companies. Musk announced in April that he would spend less time on work related to DOGE. Tesla shares are up more than 2% in premarket trading. 5. Salesforce Tops Q1 Expectations, Raises Full-Year Outlook Salesforce (CRM) on Wednesday reported first-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations and lifted its full-year outlook. The cloud software giant raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 revenue and adjusted EPS, citing demand for its AI products. Salesforce reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.58 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year rise to $9.83 billion, both above Visible Alpha consensus. Salesforce shares, which entered Thursday down 17% this year, are little changed in premarket trading. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Great Expectations 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo A cautious tone persists in today&#8217;s trading, with the three major stock market averages slightly in the red. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) shares are up 0.33% ahead of its highly anticipated quarterly earnings report expected after the closing bell. The prevailing sentiment is that Nvidia will once again exceed expectations and upgrade its guidance due to strong AI and chip demand. Yet, concerns linger regarding a potential write-down linked to China revenues, even with overall strong demand. The SPY ETF is lower by 0.16%. Consumer Spending on Deck 10:49 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive greater insight on the resilience of the consumer this week. Personal Income and Spending data for April is due out on Friday. This data follows a period of robust consumer spending observed in March. Economists at Wells Fargo anticipate a 0.3% increase in personal income and a 0.2% rise in personal spending. SPY is currently lower by 0.24%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets are treading carefully today, following yesterday&#8217;s powerful surge driven by news of EU import tariff delays. The spotlight is now firmly on corporate earnings, particularly those of chip giant Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), whose highly anticipated quarterly results are due after the market closes. Early morning trading shows stocks with minimal direction, as the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all registering modest gains. The SPY ETF is down 0.11% as of mid-morning trading. Here&#8217;s a look at the SPY over the past five trading sessions: The &#8220;Magnificent Seven&#8221; stocks are largely flat, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) up 1% and the rest of the cohort seeing mixed trading. GameStop (NYSE: GME) has dipped 3.5% today after venturing into the cryptocurrency space with its initial bitcoin acquisition exceeding $500 million, mirroring moves by MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has offloaded some TSLA shares while increasing its stake in Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings announcement.

Biotech Benefits from Generative AI 2:02 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Jefferies believes certain biotechnology stocks are poised to benefit from AI advancements. Analyst Michael Yee told CNBC that the sector is likely to save billions of dollars as well as time in getting drugs to market thanks to the role of generative AI in drug discovery. The firm is bullish on biotech stocks for the rest of 2025, saying any bad news is already built into the sector. The Nasdaq Composite is basically flat ahead of Nvidia&#8217;s earnings. Market Update 12:33 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks are continuing to play it safe in today&#8217;s trading session, with the three major stock market averages fractionally lower across the board. VP JD Vance is headlining today&#8217;s Bitcoin 2025 event, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift the BTC price, which is up about 0.17%. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock is up 0.33% today ahead of its quarterly earnings report due out this afternoon. The markets have come to expect Nvidia beating expectations and raising its guidance on strong AI and chip demand.

Personal Income &amp; Spending Preview 10:38 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive another dose of economic data on Friday when the Personal Income and Spending report for the month of April is released.

Stocks are showing little conviction in early morning trading, with the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posting fractional gains. The Magnificent Seven stocks are little changed, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) posting a 1% gain and the rest of the group trading mixed.

Both stocks have rallied by double-digit percentages in recent days. President Trump is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and tighten the window for new reactor license approvals to 18 months, a process that traditionally is infamous for being extremely lengthy. The markets are holding their gains, including a 2.1% advance in the Nasdaq Composite. Consumer Confidence Soars 10:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer Confidence surged in May, hitting 98 – a significant 12.3-point jump from April. This robust reading defied economists&#8217; predictions of 86, despite ongoing tariff concerns. The markets are widening their lead, including a nearly 2% jump in the Nasdaq Composite. Durable Goods Orders Reverse 9:55 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders fell 6.3% last month, a narrower decline than economists had anticipated but on the heels of four straight monthly increases. The latest data is a gauge on business spending in light of the tariffs. Boeing (NYSE: BA) orders were a drag, falling 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Optimism has seeped back into the markets, with all three of the major stock market averages coming out of the gate higher. President Trump announced a pause on proposed EU tariffs until July 9, fueling a 300-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Technology stocks are leading the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 each higher by over 1%. The proposed EU import tariff continues to hover at 50%, and July isn&#8217;t too far away, but for now, the markets are seeing the glass as half full. The Trump administration&#8217;s deal with the EU suggests further trade partner progress could be revealed sooner than later. Wall Street firm Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock ahead of the AI darling&#8217;s highly anticipated quarterly results due out tomorrow, advising investors to stay long on the stock and weather the uncertainty because the worst is behind them. Other Mag 7 stocks are higher today as well, including Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), each with a 1% jump. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is rallying 3.5% after Wedbush analysts labeled the EV maker an AI &#8220;pure play&#8221; and lifted the price target to $500 per share. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 378.17 (+0.89%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 275.40 (+1.5%) S&amp;P 500: Up 65.67 (+1.1%) Market Movers UBS has upgraded shares of LifeStance Health (Nasdaq: LFST) to a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on a bullish long-term outlook, sending the stock up 4%. Data analytics software stock Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is gaining 2% on the day in the tariff-fueled rally.

TSLA,2025-05-28 12:10:40,S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) Live: Markets Upbeat on EU Tariff Surprise and Resilient Economy,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/sp-500-nysearca-spy-live-markets-upbeat-on-eu-20250528.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Wall Street Endorses Nuclear Stocks 12:10 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Goldman Sachs has issued a bullish report on a pair of nuclear stocks – Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) and NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) – pointing to regulatory tailwinds from the Trump administration. Both stocks have risen by double-digit percentages since President Trump issued an executive order last week. The president is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and shorten the wait for new reactor license approvals to one and a half years, a process that historically is known for moving at a snail&#8217;s pace. Business Orders Soften 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders posted a 6.3% decline last month, a softer drop than economists had predicted. However, this dip follows four consecutive months of increases, painting a mixed picture for business spending amid ongoing tariff discussions. A significant drag on the overall figures was Boeing (NYSE: BA), whose orders plunged 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Market sentiment has turned decidedly upbeat, with all three major stock market averages seeing gains from the open. President Trump agreed to delay proposed EU tariffs until July 9, which led to a 300-point jump for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also buoying stocks is the latest round of economic data. Consumer Confidence for May came in at a stronger than expected reading of 98, up 12.3 points month-over-month. Economists were calling for a reading of 86 in the face of tariffs. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is gaining 1.45% on the day. Technology stocks powering the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 up by over 1% each. Despite the pending 50% EU import tariff and July being right around the corner, markets are satisfied with the interim relief, viewing the Trump administration&#8217;s agreement with the EU as a potential precursor to further positive trade developments. Wall Street firm Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) ahead of the AI darling&#8217;s crucial quarterly results tomorrow. The firm suggests investors hold fast, believing the most challenging period is now behind the company. Other &#8220;Magnificent Seven&#8221; members are also enjoying gains, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) both up 1%. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stands out with a 3.5% rally after Wedbush analysts elevated the EV manufacturer to an AI &#8220;pure play&#8221; and boosted its price target to $500 per share. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 488.43 (+1.1%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 376.43 (+2.0%) S&amp;P 500: Up 90.11 (+1.5%) Market Movers UBS has upgraded LifeStance Health (Nasdaq: LFST) to a &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on a positive long-term forecast, sending the stock up 4%. Data analytics software specialist Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is also up 2% today, riding the broader tariff-driven rally. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) will soon begin charging customers $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, abandoning its signature &#8220;bags fly free&#8221; policy. This strategic move is being rewarded by investors, with LUV stock gaining 3%.

The largest EV maker in the world’s largest EV market cut prices on its new models by as much as 34%. The price of its least expensive vehicle, the Seagull, will fall to $7,770. BYD’s major competitors—Geely, Li Auto, and Xpeng–matched the cuts. The Financial Times calls it an all-out price war. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Major Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers have cut prices on new models by as much as 34%. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) may have to match these cuts to keep market share. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) may have to match these cuts to keep its market share in place, which threatens its profit margins. China is Tesla’s second-largest market. The company&#8217;s margins are already under pressure. Operating income dropped 66% in the most recently reported quarter, and carbon credits also hit it. Tesla is in a race, and a drop in auto sales makes winning that race more critical. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers&#8217; Association, Tesla’s unit sales dropped 49% to 7,261 in Europe during April. Overall, EV sales in that market rose 34.1% during the same month. Investors believe that Tesla’s valuation is based more on self-driving success than unit sales. They reason that if it is the first to market with a truly autonomous vehicle, a sharp increase in car sales will follow. The company already has a service called Tesla&#8217;s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) mode. It is autonomous in many situations but warns drivers to keep their eyes on the road. Tesla’s first true self-driving vehicle, a robotaxi, will launch in Austin in late June. According to CEO Elon Musk, it will be a breakthrough. These cars will essentially drive themselves. Last year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Tesla had a lead in the auto AI sector. The Austin test may prove if he is right. But it already has challengers. The most visible is Google’s Waymo. Tesla may grab the lead in AI-controlled cars. In the meantime, Chinese EV companies sell cars outside China, which means they compete with Tesla in some countries. For the time being, that does not include the United States because of 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs. BYD has started to expand into several nations in Asia, as well as Brazil and parts of Europe. It also plans to build a plant in Hungary. BYD and some other Chinese companies claim to have self-driving features and can match Tesla’s service. If so, Tesla faces competitors who are willing to cut prices to gain market share and who have also moved into self-driving.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) gained 1.38% over the past five trading sessions, brining its one-month gain to an eye-catching 36.04% as the stock continues to rally back from disastrous losses in Q1. The recent gains have been welcomed by investors who have endured a year-do-date loss of 9.97% and seen the stock slip 28.82% since hitting its all-time high of $479.86 on Dec. 17, 2024. Buy-and-hold investors are hopeful the EV maker has found its bottom amid a highly volatile six-month stretch. But the recent rally in TSLA comes despite a poor earnings report in Q1 followed by collapsing sales figures in the U.S. and abroad. In early May, it was reported that Tesla has around $800 million worth of Cybertrucks stuck on lots. It was also reported this month that, in addition to collapsing sales in Europe broadly, Tesla has seen sales in Sweden plunges 80.7%. In April, it was reported that Tesla now accounts for fewer than 50% of EV sales in California. After absorbing enormous losses, Elon Musk&#8217;s EV empire fell outside of the $1 trillion club, but as of May 19, the company&#8217;s market cap stands at $1.09 trillion. Nonetheless, questions linger as to whether the company&#8217;s most ambitious of growth drivers (think Cybercab and Optimus humanoid robot, both of which were featured at the company&#8217;s robotaxi event last year) will bear fruit sooner rather than later. Indeed, Tesla&#8217;s stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk&#8217;s role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk&#8217;s friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla&#8217;s outlook remains clouded. In any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let&#8217;s check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it&#8217;s a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term. Key Points in This Article: Tesla remains the leader of the EV revolution, dominating global market share despite the stock&#8217;s recent struggles. The company faces numerous headwinds, which could ultimately impact its long-term performance.

The report includes a complete industry map of AI investments that includes many small caps. Tesla&#8217;s Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along For a stock that&#8217;s fallen significantly, I&#8217;d expect the growth narrative to have been severely impacted. Tesla&#8217;s latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla&#8217;s most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully. Undoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it&#8217;s one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas&#8217; view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied &#8220;AI ETF&#8221; given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes. Though Tesla&#8217;s AI efforts are exciting, it&#8217;s important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it&#8217;s to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla&#8217;s been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories? The most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there&#8217;s also the rumored &#8220;Model Q&#8221; entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a &#8220;wild card.&#8221; Bull Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price Cybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla&#8217;s robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk&#8217;s vision of the robotaxi future could be a reality within Trump&#8217;s term. Of course, a more realistic timeframe would put such a future more than 10 years out. However, if Tesla can floor it on full self-driving (FSD) efforts, perhaps such a future could be closer to the present. There&#8217;s a great deal of uncertainty with FSD, given the technical and regulatory unknowns. Either way, I view Musk&#8217;s friendship with Trump as a boon for a Cybertruck rollout under his administration. If Cybertruck expands its presence and becomes a hit within years rather than decades, TSLA stock could prove a bargain, given all that there is to gain. The big question, though, is how Cybercab will hold its own as Waymo pushes ahead with its impressive offering. Given robotaxis, like generative AI, are unlikely to be a &#8220;winner takes all&#8221; market, I think there&#8217;s no reason why both robotaxi offerings can&#8217;t win big from prime-time adoption of self-driving. Another big question to consider is whether consumers will be interested in buying up Cybercabs to have them rolling around on the streets as ride-hailers. I think the business could prove quite lucrative for buyers and Tesla&#8217;s margins over the long haul. After all, it can sell the car and continue to build a ride-hailing network while profiting from use of a ride-hailing app of sorts. Cathie Wood thinks autonomous ride-hailing could represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. If Tesla can get a nice slice, Wood sees TSLA stock at $2,600 per share by 2029. Personally, I think the bull case (for the year ahead) could see TSLA at around $550 per share — or 100.19% higher than where the stock is trading today. That target is shared by Wedbush Securities&#8217; Dan Ives, one of my favorite analysts in tech. Optimus: Optimus was a nice addition to the robotaxis event as it amused attendees. But the big question is how much potential the robot has once it&#8217;s ready to go on sale to the general public. Undoubtedly, Tesla isn&#8217;t the only one getting into the robotics game. Many Mag Seven members also investing heavily in home robots. While more rivals in home robots could be a threat to Optimus, I view it as more of a confirmation that there is a place in the home for such profound innovations. As for the home robotics market, I do see 2026 as a tad overly optimistic for a launch. However, if robot &#8220;friends&#8221; do arrive by 2030, I think Tesla&#8217;s growth rate could reaccelerate back to or even above 25% to 30% for some amount of time. Bear Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price Cybertruck: Undoubtedly, there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do before Cybertruck makes an impact on the car market. FSD capabilities need to step things up and the vehicle needs to be made in a way that won&#8217;t break the bank. These are big asks. Some bears have doubts about whether the firm can execute the opportunity. In late March, the company announced that it was recalling nearly every Cybertruck due to a potential crash risk. This was an enormous blow to Musk&#8217;s ambitions for the EV, which has already been subjected to harsh criticism about its perceived shortcomings among owners. Ross Gerber, who previously owned shares, has sold out with the view a 50% crash would be in store for 2025. He also thinks FSD &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221; If true, that&#8217;s a gut punch to Tesla&#8217;s biggest growth driver. Either way, there&#8217;s not too much room lower with TSLA now off 40%. With Guggenheim labeling TSLA stock as a Sell with a $175 target, I&#8217;d brace for even more pain if the market sell-off intensifies. That price target represents additional downside potential of 36.30% from today&#8217;s share price. Bad Press: Musk&#8217;s deteriorated image at the hands of his federal government involvement with DOGE aside, Tesla has continued to bear the brunt of bad news. In late 2024, it was widely reported that the EV maker was the most dangerous vehicle brand, with the number of deaths among all automakers, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. According to the study, Tesla has a fatal accident rate of 5.6 per billion vehicle miles, compared to the overall average of just 2.8. Additionally, ongoing protests against the brand — including vandalism and arson — have occurred around the globe, from Italy and France to numerous states in the U.S. Optimus: Even if home robots are on the horizon, good luck asking consumers to spend thousands on a proven technology. Indeed, if Vision Pro taught us anything, it&#8217;s that being an early adopter is expensive and probably not the best use of funds. Either way, I&#8217;d much rather wait and see how the robot ambitions pan out before getting too excited at this stage. Insider &amp; Institutional Activity: There&#8217;s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests investors should &#8220;follow the money.&#8221; If that&#8217;s the current case for Tesla, money is flowing out. In fact, over the past 12 years, no one single share of TSLA has been purchased by insiders (e.g., the company&#8217;s executives, directors or anyone who owns 10% or more of the company), according to Nasdaq.com. Data from Finviz supports this, even showing that Musk himself, as well as his brother, have been offloading shares since late 2024. Additionally, institutional ownership has now decreased to just 48.76%. In total, 479 institutional investors have entirely liquidated their Tesla positions, with 1,892 institutional holders having decreased their positions versus 2,015 who have increased them. Price Targets: In April, Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on Tesla to $260 from $275 while maintaining a neutral rating. The firm reduced its auto industry outlook and estimates, saying it will be difficult for the auto industry to fully pass on tariff costs, especially given softening consumer demand. Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs&#8217; one-year price target represents downside potential of 23.73% from today&#8217;s price. Increased competition: Also in April, a Jeff Bezos-backed EV company called Slate unveiled affordable EV truck and SUV models that cost $20,000 after federal incentives. The company has billed itself as the &#8220;anti-Tesla,&#8221; and is made in the U.S. As Tesla&#8217;s market share has fallen under 50% in EV-friendly California, the arrival of Slate could continue to erode sales. Base Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price The base case for Tesla lies somewhere in between the two extremes. Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $260 share, or 23.73% potential downside from today&#8217;s price. Meanwhile, the high-end target is $500 and the low-end target is $19.05. I&#8217;m inclined to view the $300 level as a fair-value level for the stock. Much of Tesla&#8217;s story depends on its big growth drivers. In the meantime, EV sales and the rise of more affordable models (Model Q) could be nearer-term stories to look forward to as one waits for the biggest of drivers to pay off. At the time of writing, TSLA stock goes for 176.56 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 9.58 times froward price-to-sales (P/S). That makes the name slightly undervalued, at least in my view.

Despite a 1% dip year-to-date in the share price, Nvidia&#8217;s underlying fundamentals remain robust based on its most recent performance. The company has the potential to shift the focus from tariffs back to earnings, which have largely beaten expectations so far. Most Wall Street analysts maintain a buy rating on NVDA stock, projecting an average 12-month price target of $164, a considerable upside from current levels of $132. Nvidia&#8217;s upcoming Q1 report is expected to shed light on the impact of tariffs implemented in early 2025. This follows strong Q4 results where the company surpassed Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings. At the time, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, “AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.” NVDA stock is currently off fractionally while the SPX ETF is off by 0.37%. Tariff Tall Tale 12:24 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pushed back against President Donald Trump&#8217;s new tariff targeting Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhones, basically calling domestic production a tall tale. &#8220;We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the [U.S.] is a fairy tale that is not feasible,&#8221; Ives stated in a report. Trump threatened that Apple could face tariffs of 25% or more on iPhones made outside the USA. Apple recently revealed its intentions to redirect production of its iPhones from China to India. Apple stock is down 2.5% today, and the SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%. Fed Uncertainty 10:45 am by Gerelyn Terzo Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee cautioned Friday that President Donald Trump’s latest tariff moves have complicated monetary policy decisions and likely pushed back any interest rate changes. The Fed previously revealed its intentions to lower interest rates twice in 2025. Goolsbee told CNBC, &#8220;Everything’s always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while we’re waiting to get some clarity.&#8221; This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. A sharp sell-off gripped the markets this Friday morning, with all three major stock market averages surrendering ground. The week is set to conclude on a sour note, following President Trump’s recent threat to levy a steep 50% tariff on the EU, a measure that could be implemented in the coming days. In a potentially encouraging sign, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses almost in half, while both the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have similarly come off their worst levels. The majority of economic sectors are trading lower, with consumer discretionary and technology stocks taking the hardest hits. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%, while the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for a 2.7% weekly decline. Bond yields are declining as the trade war escalates, bringing a volatile week for the bond market to a close. Stock market volatility has also reemerged, highlighted by a 25% increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is facing renewed pressure, with President Trump warning that iPhones produced outside the U.S. could be subject to substantial tariffs, causing Apple stock to drop 2% today. Yet, in a bright spot among the Magnificent Seven, prominent Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is optimistic about Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), boosting his price target on the electric vehicle manufacturer to $500, suggesting a 49% upside potential, alongside an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 253.11 (-0.60%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 182.34 (-0.94%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.23 (-0.77%) Market Movers Nuclear stocks are defying the downward trend today, gaining ground as the Trump administration signals favorable conditions for the industry. Companies including Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), NuScale (NYSE: SMR), and Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) are all advancing, led by a double-digit percentage gain for OKLO. Quantum computing stock IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), however, is down as much as 4.7% today, following yesterday&#8217;s rally that saw its share price close above $45. In earnings developments, Intuit (NYSE: INTU) is gaining 8.6% today while Deckers (NYSE: DECK) is sinking 21.7% on a Wall Street downgrade following disappointing results on tariff impacts.

Interest Rate Cuts in Flux 9:56 am by Gerelyn Terzo Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated Friday that President Donald Trump&#8217;s recent tariff actions have thrown a wrench into monetary policy likely delaying any adjustments to interest rates. He told CNBC: &#8220;Everything’s always on the table.

The markets are in freefall on Friday, with all three of the major stock market averages lower by at least 1%.

The cloud-based AI data storage company is largely expected to come through with flying colors. Firms like Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and Evercore ISI are all expecting Snowflake to outperform considering its resilience throughout the tariff era. Jefferies analysts aren&#8217;t wasting any time and have already raised their price target on the stock to $200 per share, reflecting 20.8% upside potential. The markets remain under pressure, including a 0.23% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. S&amp;P 500 Earnings Outlook 11:02 am by Gerelyn Terzo Most of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported Q1 earnings already, and according to Factset data, the results are largely impressive. Of the companies that have reported already, over three-quarters (78%) of S&amp;P 500 companies have revealed a positive EPS surprise, while more than half (62%) of them have surprised to the upside on revenue. Nevertheless, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that Wall Street earnings estimates on S&amp;P 500 companies have further to fall amid persistent tariff uncertainty. Improved Market Sentiment 9:55 am by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America published a report revealing that sentiment around the broader stock market has improved, with its equity risk-love indicator flipping from deep panic last month to a neutral reading most recently. If history is any indication, this improvement suggests stocks could soon revisit their record-high levels, despite today&#8217;s lackluster performance. The Nasdaq Composite is currently down 0.48%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets came out of the gate lower across the board this morning after managing to eke out slight gains yesterday. Yesterday&#8217;s market performance marked the sixth straight day of gains for the S&amp;P 500, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also moved higher. After Moody&#8217;s cut the U.S. debt rating by one notch, Deutsche Bank weighed in saying the U.S. economy is &#8220;suffering death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; The Wall Street firm&#8217;s Jim Reid wrote, &#8220;Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is one of the gainers, rising 3% and helping to offset losses in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. CEO Elon Musk has committed to staying at the helm for the next five years. Dow stock Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has no plans to pass along tariff-related costs to customers, unlike fellow Dow component Walmart&#8217;s (NYSE: WMT), which had earlier plans to do so. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 50.53 (-0.12%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 81.77 (-0.43%) S&amp;P 500: Down 19.17 (-0.33%) Market Movers Quantum stocks have captured the spotlight after D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) skyrocketed as much as 20% following the release of its newest quantum computing system. The company&#8217;s Advantage2 system is officially available via the cloud, representing its most powerful quantum offering to date, featuring greater energy and lower noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is tacking on 3.3% today as it climbs closer to its 52-week high level. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is shaving off 3.2% of its value today.

Expectations are largely high, anticipating a strong performance from the company. Analyst firms such as Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, and Evercore ISI are all forecasting an outperformance for Snowflake, citing its demonstrated resilience even amid the recent tariff challenges. Jefferies analysts, in particular, have already taken action, boosting their price target on the stock to $200 per share, indicating a potential 20.8% upside. This sense of bullishness comes as the broader markets remain under pressure, including a 0.24% decline in the SPY ETF. Earnings Roundup 11:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first-quarter earnings season still unfolding, the performance of most S&amp;P 500 companies has proven notably robust. FactSet data illustrates this strength: a significant 78% of reporting S&amp;P 500 firms delivered a positive earnings per share (EPS) surprise, and over half (62%) also exceeded revenue forecasts. Despite these strong results, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sounded a cautionary note, suggesting that Wall Street&#8217;s current earnings estimates for S&amp;P 500 companies may still need to be adjusted downward amidst ongoing tariff uncertainty. The SPY ETF remains lower by 0.26% as of late morning trading. BofA: Stock Market Sentiment Is Looking Up 10:29 am by Gerelyn Terzo A recent report from Bank of America indicates a notable shift in broader stock market sentiment. The firm&#8217;s equity risk-love indicator has now transitioned from a state of deep panic recorded last month to a neutral reading in its latest assessment. Historically, such an improvement often signals that stocks may soon retest their previous record-high levels. The SPY ETF is currently down a slight 0.30%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets opened on a subdued note across the board this morning, with all three of the major stock market averages edging lower. If the S&amp;P 500 can turn it around like it did yesterday, it will mark its seventh-straight winning session for the broader market index. The SPY ETF remains lower by a slight 0.30%. After Moody&#8217;s cut the U.S. debt rating by one notch, Deutsche Bank responded with its assessment that the U.S. economy is experiencing a &#8220;death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds. Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Jim Reid wrote, “Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.” Despite the broader market&#8217;s struggles, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is an outlier, climbing 3% and offering some counterweight to the losses seen in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. Tesla boss Elon Musk vowed to remain at the helm of the EV maker for the next five years. On the Dow, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has indicated it won&#8217;t pass tariff-related costs onto consumers, a different approach compared to fellow Dow component Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which had earlier signaled price increases. Here’s a look at the performance as of mid-morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 98.87 (-0.23%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 95.66 (-0.49%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.48 (-0.33%) Market Movers Quantum computing stocks are capturing attention. D-Wave Quantum (Nasdaq: QBTS) surged as much as 20% this morning after launching its newest quantum computing system. The company&#8217;s Advantage2 system, now accessible via the cloud, represents its most powerful offering yet, boasting enhanced energy efficiency and reduced noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is adding 3.3% to its value today, nearing its 52-week high. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is shedding 3.2% of its value, and Airbnb (Nasdaq: ABNB) is down 3.1% following an order from Spain to delist tens of thousands of short-term rental properties.

Among those that have already reported, more than three-quarters (78%) of S&amp;P 500 companies posted a positive EPS surprise, while close to two-thirds (62%) also beat their revenue projections. This positive trend, however, is tempered by a warning from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who cautions that Wall Street&#8217;s earnings estimates on S&amp;P 500 companies have further to decline given persistent tariff uncertainty. The SPX ETF remains lower by 0.42%. Stock Market Outlook: BofA 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Bank of America, investor sentiment regarding the wider stock market has seen an uptick. The Wall Street firm&#8217;s equity risk-love indicator, which showed deep panic just last month, has most recently registered a neutral position. Should the pattern persist, this positive change suggests that equities could soon move to challenge their all-time highs. The SPX ETF remains lower by 0.35%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets began the day on a weaker footing today, largely giving back the slight advances seen yesterday. Yesterday&#8217;s session was notable for extending the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s winning streak to six straight days, with both the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also moving into positive territory. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.35% as of mid-morning trading. Moody&#8217;s downgraded the U.S. debt rating, prompting Deutsche Bank to declare the U.S. economy is experiencing a &#8220;death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; But the outlook also suggests the U.S. economy is at the tail end of that downward spiral. Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid wrote in a note, “Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.” Amidst the overall declines, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stands out, gaining 3% and helping to cushion the drops in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. Dow component Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has signaled it won&#8217;t be passing on tariff-related expenses to customers, a contrasting strategy to Walmart (NYSE: WMT), another Dow component, which had previously indicated such plans before the White House urged them otherwise. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 58.88 (-0.14%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 59.95 (-0.31%) S&amp;P 500: Down 12.18 (-0.20%) Market Movers The quantum computing sector is making headlines, driven by D-Wave Quantum (Nasdaq: QBTS), which saw its shares jump by up to 20%. This surge follows the release of its latest quantum computing system, the Advantage2, now available through the cloud. The company highlights this as its most potent quantum offering to date, featuring improved energy performance and lower operational noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is up 3.3% and inching closer to its 52-week high. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is losing 3.2% of its value. Airbnb (Nasdaq: ABNB) is down 3.1% after Spanish authorities mandated the removal of numerous short-term rental listings.

TSLA,2025-05-20 13:35:13,Elon Musk says he will cut back on political spending after heavily backing Trump in 2024,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/elon-musk-says-he-will-cut-back-on-political-spending-20250520.png,https://www.marketscreener.com,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key financial supporter of President Donald Trump, said Tuesday that he'll be spending “a lot less” on political campaigns, a reversal that could be a setback for Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Musk disclosed his decision via videoconference during a Bloomberg forum in Doha, Qatar. It speaks to his possible disenchantment with politics after his tumultuous tenure as Trump's pick to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which has fallen far short of its goals for reducing federal spending. Musk has scaled back his government role to spend more time at his businesses, including Tesla, which have seen intense blowback. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); “In terms of political spending I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk said. Asked why, he responded that “I think I’ve done enough.” Musk's statement marks a reversal of the course he had set during the 2024 campaign — when he was among the very top political spenders — and immediately after. Musk spent at least $250 million supporting Trump in the presidential campaign, as the main contributor to America PAC, a super PAC that was active in advertising and funding door-to-door canvassing groups across the seven most-competitive states in the November presidential election. Musk relished in the publicity, campaigning alongside Trump at times and headlining some of his own campaign rallies on the GOP nominee's behalf. And while he took credit for helping Trump return to the White House, Musk suffered a public defeat in April, after he became deeply involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign. Musk-backed groups America PAC and Rebuilding America's Future spent more than $21 million on the April 1 election in support of the Republican-backed candidate Brad Schimel. But Schimel's defeat by 10 percentage points in Wisconsin, a state Trump carried just five months earlier, was a blow to Musk, who campaigned for Schimel in Green Bay the weekend before the election and had also pledged to enforce Trump's agenda in the 2026 midterm elections. A week after Trump's November victory, Musk said the political action committees he supported would “play a significant role in primaries,” adding later that he might help finance Republican challengers to GOP members of Congress who did not support Trump's nominees. “How else? There is no other way,” Musk wrote on X, which he rebranded after purchasing Twitter, in response to the suggestion of supporting intraparty challenges. An adviser to Musk’s PACs declined to comment Tuesday. Once Trump took office, Musk held a prominent role as an adviser and leader of DOGE. He and his acolytes in the department fanned out widely across the federal government to enact deep cuts to the workforce and spending, in some cases seeking to shutter entire agencies altogether. DOGE has pushed to fire tens of thousands of workers in downsizing at agencies, ranging from the IRS to Health and Human Services, and pressured tens of thousands more to take buyout and early retirement offers. And they sought to shut down agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. With backing from DOGE, agencies have cancelled tens of thousands of government contracts and grants that they say do not align with the administration’s priorities. Some of those moves were done so quickly that they had to be reversed after pushback or court rulings finding that they were illegal. Critics say it amounts to a reckless chain-saw approach that could destroy much of the nation’s apolitical civil service, impair services for vulnerable populations, and halt critical research. DOGE claims on its “Wall of Receipts” it has saved an estimated $170 billion, but those savings numbers have been shown to be flawed and inflated in many cases. Musk's role prompted intense pushback, including protests at his electric vehicle company, Tesla. Speaking to reporters earlier this month as he prepared to step back from DOGE, Musk noted the backlash. “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun,” he said. “Seeing cars burning is not fun,” he added, referring to the instances of Tesla cars being smashed or set on fire. Musk's announced intention to step back from political spending comes during multiple new business opportunities, including a deal to host the latest versions of his Grok artificial intelligence chatbot on Microsoft’s data centers. Meanwhile, his brain-computer interface company Neuralink is planning to implant its experimental devices in dozens more people and his electric-vehicle company Tesla is developing a humanoid robot that Musk hopes to one day send to Mars. Musk could change his mind about campaign spending. The 2026 midterm campaigns are just getting off the ground, while some candidates have not yet announced their candidacy for elections that remain 18 months away. But as of Tuesday, Musk said he did not expect to. “Well, if I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,"" Musk said. ""I do not currently see a reason.” ————————————————————————————————— Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa. Foley reported from Iowa City, Iowa.

Tesla (TSLA) shares fell to open the week as part of a broader market decline that comes after Moody's Ratings downgraded its view of the United States' creditworthiness after markets closed on Friday. Several other large tech stocks were down in early Monday trading (follow Investopedia's coverage of the day's market moves here) after strong performances last week. A Monday decline would also be a departure from Tesla's recent performance, as the electric vehicle maker's stock has ended the week higher than where it started in each of the last four weeks. Upbeat news about macro events like trade negotiations with other countries has boosted Tesla stock along with the larger market in recent weeks, despite disappointing sales and registration figures coming out for Tesla across a number of European countries and China.

It stands at $381 billion, and it is rising sharply. According to Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, co-founder of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), is a distant second at $227 billion. Key Points Elon Musk&#8217;s Net Worth Is Almost $400 billion. Tesla&#8217;s Stock Price Recovery Is A Factor Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The primary catalyst for the increase is Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock recovery. He co-founded the EV company and is CEO. Tesla’s market cap is $1.13 trillion, which ranks it eighth among all public companies. Musk owns 13% of the shares outstanding. Tesla’s stock has risen 44% in the last month, while the S&amp;P is up 18%. That contrasts with the price year to date, which is down 13%, while the market is flat over the same period. Tesla continues to have challenges. After years of rising, the company delivered 1.789 million vehicles in 2024, down 1.07% from 2023. The problem has worsened this year. In the first quarter, deliveries fell 13% to 336,681. In some EU nations, the percentage drop was higher. Tesla is also losing ground in China, the world’s largest EV market. Local Chinese companies, particularly BYD, have hampered its sales. Musk’s relationship with President Trump has also eroded sales. Other Musk holdings have helped his overall wealth. The largest of these is the most successful rocket maker in the world. SpaceX virtually controls the U.S. rocket business and is the leader in the industry worldwide. It has established itself as the preeminent rocket launch provider, lofting satellites, cargo, and people to space for NASA, the Pentagon, and commercial partners. It is building out a large network of Starlink satellites providing internet service. Some observers believe Musk’s relationship with President Trump could help him get additional business from the U.S. government. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX and has 79% of the company’s voting shares. He can make decisions about SpaceX without challenge. SpaceX was recently valued at $350 billion. Among Musk’s other holdings, the most valuable may eventually be xAI, a major rival to OpenAI in the race to control the future of AI. xAI recently raised $6 billion, which puts its value at between $40 billion and $50 billion. Musk owns over half of xAI. The valuation of OpenAI recently hit $157 billion. Musk recently merged xAI with social media company X. The value of these combined is $100 billion Musk owns parts of several other companies, including social media platform X and implantable brain-computer interface operation Neuralink.

Key Points The best-selling cars internationally are not just the most well-known brands worldwide. Tesla might have some of the best-selling cars, but it’s not the most popular car everywhere it’s sold. Countries like China and India see big numbers with homegrown brands.

Using data from websites like Motor1, we can determine which cars are the hottest-selling in various countries across Europe, South America, Asia, and other spots worldwide. 20. Tata Punch The best-selling car model in India in 2024 was the Tata Punch, which sold an impressive 202,030 units. Given the Punch&#8217;s small size, it&#8217;s ideal for city use and navigating India&#8217;s frequently crowded streets. 19. Toyota Vios The best-selling car in the Philippines was undeniably the Toyota Vios, which in 2024 sold 43,636 units, helping Toyota continue its domination of the country&#8217;s market. As of 2024, Toyota had almost 50% of the Philippines&#8217; car market. 18. Lada Granta In Russia, the best-selling car was the Lada Granta, a homegrown brand, with sales totaling 201,500 units. The Granta was followed by another Lada model, the Vesta, which sold 123,200 units. 17. Toyota Hilux The Toyota Hilux was the best-selling vehicle in Thailand, Iraq, Oman, Yemen, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Nigeria, Malawi, and New Caledonia. In Malawi alone, the Hilux represented over 17% of all new car sales, which jumped to 27.6% in Nigeria. 16. Nissan Versa With 93,278 units sold in 2024, the Nissan Versa is the best-selling vehicle in Mexico. The Nissan NP300, March, and Kicks also secured four out of the top ten spots in Mexico in 2024, giving the brand a very comfortable presence there. 15. Ford F-150 The Ford F-Series claimed the best-selling car spot for the 59th consecutive year in Canada, with 133,857 units sold. Sales were so strong that they gave the company an 8.6% bump over 2023. 14. Fiat Strada The Fiat Strada was Brazil&#8217;s best-selling car in 2024, selling 144,684 units. Unlike other Fiat models, it is a subcompact pickup truck, which is typically a very small subcompact car made for tight European roads. 13. Suzuki Vitara The Suzuki Vitara, which sold over 7,000 units in 2024, is currently the best-selling car in Hungary. While Suzuki may not be the big name it once was in America, this does not hurt sales internationally. 12. Dacia Sandero Spain’s biggest seller might come as a surprise, as the Dacia Sandero takes the top spot in the Spanish market. Selling 32,994 units in 2024, the subcompact car is manufactured by Dacia as a subsidiary of Renault. 11. Dacia Logan Yet another brand that will be unfamiliar outside of Europe, the Dacia Logan is a name that needs no introduction in Romania. With 14,974 units sold in 2024, the subsidiary of French manufacturer Renault is currently offered as a subcompact sedan. 10. Ford Puma Surprisingly, not available in the United States, the Ford Puma is an American-branded vehicle that sells very well in the United Kingdom. The subcompact crossover Puma, which only came to market in 2019, is already the top seller with 48,340 units sold in 2024. 9. Fiat Panda There is no question Italians love Italian vehicles, and so the top spot in Italy belongs to the Fiat Panda. Selling 99,871 units in 2024, the small size of the Panda is ideal for jetting around Italy’s tight turns and roads. 8. Hyundai Tucson For residents of Ireland, the Hyundai Tucson has become the go-to vehicle for getting around town. Selling 4,679 units in 2024, this reliable and popular vehicle offers a compact style that can more than handle Ireland’s changing weather patterns. 7. Renault Clio Unsurprisingly, the homegrown brand Renault dominates the top spot in France, with the Renault Clio selling 91,435 models in 2025. Outside of France, the Clio is also a big seller in Northern Ireland, Slovenia, North Macedonia, and the island of Martinique. 6. Skoda Octavia Although not a well-known name in the US, the Skoda Octavia remains hugely popular in Bulgaria and Croatia, selling 1,956 and 4,131 models respectively in 2024. Currently in its fourth generation, the Octavia is available in a five-door “liftback” and a five-door “estate” style. 5. BMW X1 It’s not often that you see BMW as a top seller given its price point, but in Belgium, for the last two years, the BMW X1 has excelled at attracting customers, with 15,328 models sold in 2024 alone. 4. Volkswagen Golf The Volkswagen Golf is the best seller in Austria, with 8,670 units sold in 2024 alone. Thankfully, the Golf’s popularity doesn’t end in Austria as it also remains a big seller in France, Italy, Belgium, and Romania, where the hatchback size perfectly matches smaller streets. 3. Toyota Corolla Across Finland and Poland, the Toyota Corolla reigns supreme, selling more than 72,609 units in Finland and over 20,000 units in Poland. The Corolla was also the best-selling car in Japan, followed by the Yaris and Sienta. 2. Tesla Model Y The Tesla Model Y was the best-selling vehicle in the Netherlands in 2024, accounting for 13% of all vehicle sales. This amounts to 16,858 units in the Netherlands, while it also sold 14,992 models in Sweden as the best-selling model. 1. BYD Song The BYD Song is the best-selling car in China, selling 574,351 units, as it is a beloved Chinese crossover SUV, which offers both plug-in hybrid and electric versions.

When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.

Nevertheless, the markets are holding onto gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 each up over 1% as further trade details between the U.S. and the U.K. emerge. Also, the bitcoin price is hovering back above the $100,000 level on news of a deal involving crypto exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN).

Stocks remain lower out of caution. Markets Hold Back 12:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s government officials have come out swinging against the White House, saying they strongly opposes what they described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA).

Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock.

Earlier today, President Trump proved that he was willing to lower tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level.

Aimless Markets 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo Today&#8217;s gains have faded as traders hold out for closure on a trade agreement between the U.S. and China. The three major indices are now trading mixed, including a 0.06% gain in the S&amp;P 500, 0.13% gain in the Nasdaq Composite and 0.13% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Markets are likely to continue trading aimlessly until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. S&amp;P 500 This Week 10:15 am by Gerelyn Terzo Despite today&#8217;s gains, the S&amp;P 500 remains modestly lower for the week, with a 0.06% decline as of Friday morning. There&#8217;s still time for the index to push even higher, especially if the White House announces further tariff agreements with international trade partners. CNBC reported that the broader market index remains mired below a key resistance level, making it difficult for it to break out higher. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Tariffs are having a live by the sword, die by the sword effect, and today that is translating to gains. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from over 100% to 80%, saying that level seems reasonable as Washington, D.C. gears up for negotiations with Beijing. Stocks are rightfully cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning but keeping it modest. The SPX ETF is gaining 0.25% as of morning trading. China could be the first of many tariff deals in the works with U.S. trade partners, according to the White House, further lifting market sentiment. Most sectors of the economy are moving higher, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are participating in the gains, with Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) rising 1% while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is adding 6.8%. TSLA stock is on its way to reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being lifted in part by Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a desirable Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 82.49 (+0.20%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 114.14 (+0.63%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22.51 (+0.40%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but it&#8217;s also one of the leading tech stocks. As of Thursday, Palantir was added to the top-10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, with a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. Comparatively, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers below that level at $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is taking it on the chin today, down fractionally. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is skyrocketing by over 20% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue soared by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%.

Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda. As part of his America First vision, President Trump is looking to make the U.S. economy more appealing to investors amid a strategy involving tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; oh my. While the markets await further details on trade talk progress, the three major stock market averages are mixed, including a slight gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Tariff Uncertainty Remains 11:36 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned higher, managing a 7-point gain after starting the session in the red. Meanwhile, technology stocks continue to weigh on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. According to TD Cowen, tariff-related price hikes are set to rear their heads in May&#8217;s inflation print. Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs. Selling Eases 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure this morning but are off their lowest levels of the session. Netflix (Nasdaq; NFLX) shares are off about 2% on the day after last week&#8217;s rally. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is falling 8% on the day after reporting its Q1 results, while industry peer Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 2%.

In addition to earnings, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell set to comment on the economy this week, suggesting it could be yet another roller coaster ride for investors. First-quarter earnings season continues to roll on, with names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) on the docket in the coming days. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red out of the gate, including a 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. Mag Seven stocks are mixed while the sell-off continues to unfold in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) shares, with a 2% decline today. All sectors of the economy are currently lower, the most severe of which is happening in energy stocks, which are down 2% this morning as the oil price continues its descent. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) has reached the end of an era now that billionaire Warren Buffett announced his retirement after six decades at the helm. With $300 million in cash on the sidelines, BRK-B is losing 6% on the day for a market cap of $1.09 trillion. Greg Abel will succeed Buffett at year-end 2025.

Stocks are awaiting further details on trade deals, which the White House has revealed could come as soon as this week, which would not be soon enough for the markets. Ford (NYSE: F) stock fell just over 1% on the day ahead of the automaker&#8217;s quarterly results after the closing bell today.

Bessent&#8217;s remarks failed to provide any greater clarity on the status of tariff negotiations with key U.S. trade partners, leaving the markets at a standstill. The three major stock market averages remain mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving higher while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower.

Zimmer Biomet (NYSE: ZBH) is also down 9%. In what is proving to be a volatile session on Wall Street, the markets have come off their lows of the session. The markets are coming off the heels of a nine-day winning streak and have come out of the gate with plenty of headlines to process, chief among which has been the announced retirement of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett. Wall Street firm TD Cowen has issued a report suggesting that price increases from tariffs will be reflected in May&#8217;s inflation data. The Federal Reserve gathers this week to determine the near-term outlook on interest rates while the markets will also be paying close attention to the tone in comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. First-quarter earnings continues to unfold as names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) take the spotlight. Mag Seven stocks are a mixed bag as shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) extend their losses with a 2% decline today. Sectors of the economy were originally all lower but industrials and telecom stocks have since made their way into the green. Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) shares are lower after President Trump tossed in fresh tariffs on foreign-made films. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 50.53 (-0.12%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 133.34 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.82 (-0.58%) Market Movers Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) is down 6% but maintains a $1.1 trillion market cap as Buffett prepares to pass the reins to his successor Greg Abel at the end of the year.

TSLA,2025-05-02 14:02:15,"I Always Dreamed of Driving a Tesla Model 3, But These 8 Red Flags Changed My Mind",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/i-always-dreamed-of-driving-a-tesla-model-3-20250502.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"As one of the most popular electric vehicles on the planet, the Tesla Model 3 needs no introduction. Not only is it one of the most purchased electric vehicles, but it’s also one of the best-selling vehicles overall. Between good looks, range, and a giant infotainment screen, the Tesla Model 3 has won over millions of customers to the electric world. Key Points The Tesla Model 3 is one of the best-selling electric vehicles in the country. Historically, there have been plenty of problems with Model 3 build quality. Full Self Driving has yet to show its promise for Model 3 owners. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Of course, having a large touchscreen alone doesn’t necessarily mean the Tesla Model 3 is worth owning. As with any popular car, the Model 3 has been hit with plenty of concerns and issues over the years, including the unique reputation of company CEO, Elon Musk, which may have you avoiding it for a competitor when you finish reading. 8. Buggy Software The Tesla Model 3 is reliant on the touchscreen. When it works, the idea of a vehicle receiving software updates like a phone or computer is incredible. There is no question that Tesla has set the stage for every vehicle manufacturer to rely on software updates for years to come, as software controls every vehicle function. Software Glitches Matter Even minor software glitches can be a big problem. Whether it’s a frozen screen or rebooting while parked, Tesla has positioned itself as cutting-edge, and sometimes this means aggravation. Suppose you don’t want to worry about this affecting your rearview camera, autopilot, or steering assistance. In that case, you might want to skip a vehicle that is so heavily reliant on improvements through software updates. 7. Image Perception The Tesla Model 3 has a CEO problem. Right now, the image of the Tesla Model 3 is one of danger, as Elon Musk has taken a polarizing position in the Trump Administration. Regardless of your feelings on the administration, there are frequent protests at Tesla dealerships due to Elon Musk being largely behind government job cuts. Can’t Ignore Politics Elon Musk has become increasingly controversial. There should never be a time when politics dictates which vehicle someone drives, but it’s hard to ignore what’s happening in the world. As a result, some people will resist buying a Tesla Model 3 as a form of protest over its CEO&#8217;s controversial public persona. Right or wrong, this is a reason people are not purchasing or selling their existing Model 3 vehicles. 6. Autopilot Cost Full Self Driving works, but isn&#8217;t as good as promised. Tesla and Elon Musk, in particular, have heavily touted using the Autopilot functionality as the Tesla Model 3’s most significant selling point. While this is true for most Tesla models, there are some instances in which Full Self Driving has led to accidents that should give you room to pause. Not Ready Yet The hope is that self-driving will work better in the future. Yes, you can use full self-driving, and, if you want it forever, you need to pay upward of $8,000 or more. This is a crazy high price for a feature that doesn’t come close to delivering on what was initially promised. You can’t let any car drive itself without significant concerns about harming others or other vehicles. 5. Minimalist Interior The Model 3 remains very sparse without buttons. There is no question that the increase in electric car popularity has caused vehicle manufacturers to consider minimizing the number of buttons inside a vehicle&#8217;s interior. Tesla took it to the extreme by limiting the number of buttons to as few as possible. While some buttons are on the steering wheel, most everything happens through the infotainment screen. No More Buttons The Model 3 has almost zero buttons besides the steering wheel. What’s annoying about this is that nearly every critical operation of the Tesla Model 3 takes place on the touchscreen. You must quickly glance at the screen for most operations, which means taking your hands off the wheel. This is opposed to being able to adjust climate control or vehicle sound without leaving the wheel. 4. Range Worries There are concerns with Tesla&#8217;s range. The overall range is one of the biggest reasons I worry about buying a vehicle like the Tesla Model 3. When you factor in how easy it is to gas up a car while on a road trip, you know you can get gas and return in minutes. Unfortunately, unless you buy a Model 3 strictly for driving around town, you must factor in range and charging. Long Charging Times Charging a Tesla can take some time, even with a Supercharger. Yes, you can recharge fairly quickly at a Tesla Supercharger station, but you have to be able to not only find a Supercharger station, but as these stations are still too few and far between, you have to get in line. Given that charging a vehicle can take 20-30 minutes, plus the time you might need to wait to access a charge, range worries are not something to ignore. 3. Cold Weather Performance Model 3&#8217;s lose range in the winter months. If you’re looking to buy an electric vehicle, the Tesla Model 3 will undoubtedly raise questions about how much range it will lose in colder weather. While reports vary, seeing a range drop by 20-30% in frigid weather isn’t something to ignore. Why This Matters Driving a Tesla in cold weather has tradeoffs. If you live in a warm-weather area like Florida or Southern California, you don’t have to worry about too much of a range impact based on cold weather. However, if you live anywhere in the Northern United States, this is a cold-weather staple, and range loss during the winter months may affect your plan, including how frequently you need to charge. 2. Costly Repairs Teslas have costly repairs. Should the time come when your Tesla Model 3 needs to be repaired, whether because of build quality concerns or some other repair need, you should expect high repair costs. Given the complex design of the Model 3, electric vehicles in general, and Tesla’s proprietary parts, sometimes you can see repair costs upward of 20% more than comparable vehicles. Why This Matters Tesla locations are only found in heavily populated areas. Nobody likes surprise expenses, and vehicle repairs can be among the most surprising and the biggest headaches. In other words, between Tesla’s still somewhat sparse repair network and repairs that can take longer than other dealerships, it’s a real pain in the you know what. 1. Build Quality Concerns Build concerns have plagued Tesla for years. Among the biggest reasons, if not the most important, to avoid the Tesla Model 3 is questionable build quality. This has been plaguing Tesla for years, and the company has not been able to address it in a way that has restored confidence in the Model. Why This Matters Tesla&#8217;s build concerns are still present, even years after launch. Build quality matters a great deal when you are spending thousands of dollars on a vehicle. There is a definite reason to skip the Model 3, between thinning paint and misaligned panels. Perhaps worst of all, there is a genuine concern over resale value for those who have purchased the Model 3.

After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

The University of Michigan published the final reading of its consumer sentiment index, which rose 52.2 compared with its initial view of 50.8 earlier this month. Economists were expecting the reading to remain flat. Nevertheless, the index fell sharply from March levels and has been on the decline in 2025.

By turning him into a financial trading wizard, the drug propels him into the stratosphere of high finance. As Eddie relishes his luxurious lifestyle and newfound respect and admiration, he becomes addicted to the drug, the money, and the power, despite increasing mental blackouts, unexplained gaps in his memory, and the threat of mobsters seeking to steal the drug from him. While not a primary aspect of the plot, the underlying theme of addiction in multiple forms is reiterated on several levels while the escalation of the cycle and the difficulty in jumping off the carousel is also explored. It becomes a trap for Eddie, since the fear of returning to his previously humble and failing life outweighs the growing memory and mental problems being triggered by the drug. The threats to Eddie’s life by the Russian mob finally shock him into the realization as to how much else he risks by staying on the ever spinning hamster wheel he has created for himself. The fast track grind is unrelenting, and the temptation to remain on it often outweighs more rational concerns for one’s own mental and physical well-being. Just like a drug addiction, the craving for the momentary thrills of making big profits or collecting big paychecks subsumes common sense safeguards and rational behavior. Combating burnout, especially when finances are not the sole motivation, becomes trickier in identifying the causes and devising the solutions. Key Points The fast lane of 8-figure plus sized deals can be seductive and addictive, becoming a continuous cycle that is difficult to leave. Even with the commensurate financial rewards from a successful career managing huge sums, finding personal fulfillment on a deeper level can elude many who stay in the fast lane. A broader definition and discussion of the nature of success can be helpful in dealing with the pressure and mental toll from the challenges of maintaining the hamster wheel.

Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) “Maybe FatFIRE Isn’t About Freedom. Maybe It’s Just Wage Slavery In A Gucci Suit.” The inability to leave the fast track grind after building a net worth of $80 million indicates underlying deep seated insecurities and a prospective psychological and emotional burnout and meltdown. Surprisingly, some people who have achieved profound success can lament about how it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. A Reddit fan who is probably in the top 10% of the 1% richest people posted his personal impressions on the emptiness of reaching the pinnacle of the pyramid. His details were as follows: The poster claims his net worth is roughly $80 million. His assets include multiple liquid forms (i.e. stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) as well as private equity. The poster’s business is self-owned, so he has no boss, no Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metric hanging over his head, and no fixed 9-5 office hours. Contrary to his expectations, his success seems to have only migrated him to the same type of obligations and daily grind as when he was an employee. He finds his current situation is giving him the same stress and optimization addictions, albeit with “better wine, fancier vacations, and the illusion of control.” While no longer managing the funds of clients, the poster is now managing his own portfolio, putting him in the role of “CFO of his personal empire”, with added pressures and no other life beyond work. Ironically, he finds that the pursuit of FatFIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) has left him stuck on the hamster wheel, irrationally paranoid of becoming irrelevant if he jumps off. Redefining Success The first step in ending an addiction to the fast track is to consciously take a step back to reassess priorities and find oneself, which is something more than a job or its title. As one might expect, the range of responses was very broad. A number of the responses thought it was a LARP (Live Action Role Play) hoax, with some accusing the poster of actually being a ChatGPT Bot. Others were incredulous, finding the poster’s complaints to be hysterically funny, and thinking it was a ridiculous attempt at virtual signaling for victimhood amidst his $80 million accumulated wealth. Several unsympathetic respondents shot back with a mix of envy and resentment: “At $80 million, you’re working for your ego.” “Ego grows faster than wealth.” “Narcissists are in a prison of their own making.” “You need a life. Go find one.” “The problem is you.” “Cry me a river.” “If it helps you feel better, you’re already irrelevant.” “You made your business your personality and your identity. We all need something to bring us joy other than our job title.” To be fair to the skeptics, the poster apparently had posted 6 months ago asking for investment advice to allocate monthly savings to set up accounts for his kids. It’s doubtful that someone who legitimately has amassed $80 million net worth would not have professional financial advisors and estate planners under retainer already for such a purpose. That said, the topic is certainly a legitimate one that is not without precedent. There were some constructive critiques and helpful suggestions posted in response that are good food for thought: One respondent suggested a redefinition of success to extend beyond simply one’s self and making money to have consideration for others. Satisfaction can be found in creating a legacy to help one’s family for future generations. Type-A personalities who relish competing with their peers often don’t know how to live any other way, so taking a break to reset and assess priorities can offer some sorely needed respite. One respondent psychoanalyzed the poster as existentially running from death and filling the void with activity. Anxiety is expressed by the inability to say “no” to another board seat, etc. The RE part of FIRE is to retire into something with meaning. Not just quit your job once you’ve got enough cash. A former pro athlete advised that the only way to take the retirement plunge is to consciously take the step and be honest with yourself to help work through the reinvention process. Having a wealthy financial situation that affords one retirement options can include such activities as: Angel Investing, advising, charitable foundation management, as well as diversions, like travel, hobbies, meditation, fitness, and spending quality time with family and friends. From someone who conquered being in a similar predicament: Freedom isn’t absolute &#8211; it’s a spectrum we negotiate, often unconsciously. Unpacking the real you demands deep introspection and a step back from the C-suite treadmill. Unplug, strip away the noise, and rediscover your own voice. The stakes are low &#8211; you can always return to the grind if it calls. For you &#8211; success is the baseline. The real challenge is redefining it on your terms. Step off the track and recalibrate &#8211; the returns will outpace anything you’ve pitched in the boardroom. One respondent who had attained a similar net worth exited and put his holdings into 80/20 (growth/income) funds so he would have the freedom to travel, spend time with family, learn new skills and play video games. Several who lauded the poster’s choice to stay in the grind pointed out these observations: People who think it’s about ego are off-base. We work for our FUTURE SELVES, and our family. Jeff Bezos had to ask himself “What happens on Day 2?” after he retired from Amazon. Fearing Day 2 means the decision has yet to be truly made. It’s easier to decide to DO something than NOT to do something. If Elon quit after making $180 million with PayPal, we would never have Tesla, X, Starlink, SpaceX, or The Boring Company, so there’s nothing wrong with staying in the game when others might have dropped out earlier.
