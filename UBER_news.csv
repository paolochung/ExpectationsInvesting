The Platinum Card® from American Express, a Motley Fool Money advertising partner, is known for luxury travel, packed with over $1,500 in annual perks. But some of the lesser-known benefits are perfect for foodies.Trust me -- my wife is a foodie. She's the kind of person who'll wait in line for four hours for a pop-up taco stand she saw trending on TikTok. If there's a way to sniff out great food (or a sneaky dining perk), she'll find it.

Uber credits you can eatMost people think the Amex Platinum Card's $200 annual Uber Cash benefit is just for rides -- but food lovers know better.Once you add your Amex Platinum Card to your Uber Wallet, you'll get $15 in Uber Cash every month (boosted to $35 in December). Terms apply; enrollment may be required. That credit can go straight to Uber Eats -- perfect for Friday night sushi, Sunday bagels, or anything that doesn't involve dishes.Just make sure to use it each month, since the credits don't roll over. I once used our December bonus for an emergency dessert delivery to my very pregnant sister-in-law. Totally justified.2. Activate ""Amex Offers"" in your appThis is hands-down one of the most underused perks of the Amex Platinum Card: Amex Offers.Inside the Amex app or desktop site, you'll find a rotating list of deals you can add to your card. These can include things like discounts at local bakeries or diners, or opportunities to earn more points at select restaurants. Amex Offers are all limited-time deals, personalized to your individual spending habits and preferences. So it pays to check the app regularly and see which offers are available to you.Right now in my Amex app, I can see:$5 off a $20 purchase at Wahlburgers (Marky Mark's family restaurants)Spend $100 and get $20 back at STK Steakhouse (can use up to four times)Cash back discounts at Snake River Farms, Ivy Restaurants, and The Palm in LA.To activate an offer, just tap ""Add to Card,"" then the bonus kicks in automatically when you make the purchase.Whether you're looking for a new spot to try or snagging a coupon to a place you go regularly, Amex Offers is a hidden gem. Terms apply; enrollment may be required.Ready to save on your next night out? Apply for The Platinum Card® from American Express today and see which foodie offers you qualify for.3. VIP dining access through ResyHere's another killer perk for epicurious folks: Amex and Resy have teamed up to give Amex Platinum Card members exclusive access to some of the best seats in the house.Resy Global Dining Access helps you get exclusive reservations, early booking windows, and curated Amex events at top restaurants. Terms apply. Think chef collabs, tasting menus, or first dibs on tables that are normally booked.And it's not just for New York or LA -- Resy partners with top spots all across the country. I've got my eye on a table at the fancy 88 Club restaurant in LA for my 10-year wedding anniversary. Shhh…it's a surprise for my wife!Make the most of your Amex Platinum Card benefitsMost people think travel cards are only good for airport lounges and hotel upgrades. But savvy foodies can experience a whole other side of the Amex Platinum Card.To get the most from that $695 annual fee (see rates and fees), you've gotta sniff out every perk, big or small. From surprise reservation access to bonus points on your favorite meals, it all adds up.Apply for The Platinum Card® from American Express today, because great food always tastes better when your card foots part of the bill.",https://www.fool.com/money/credit-cards/articles/3-little-known-foodie-perks-of-the-amex-platinum-card/

UBER,2025-05-23 10:10:18,What will no taxes on tips cost in foregone tax revenue?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/what-will-no-taxes-on-tips-cost-in-foregone-20250523.jpg,https://www.foxbusiness.com,"A key element of the tax-cut package that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are working to pass got approved by the Senate as a standalone measure, though it carries a significant cost. The Senate unexpectedly passed the No Tax on Tips Act late Tuesday when Sen. Jack Rosen, D-Nev., spoke in favor of the bill, which Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., introduced earlier this year with Rosen as an original co-sponsor. Rosen asked for unanimous consent to pass the bill, and when no senators on hand objected, it passed the upper chamber. ""No Tax on Tips was one of President Trump’s key promises to the American people, which he unveiled in my state of Nevada, and I am not afraid to embrace a good idea, wherever it comes from,"" Rosen said of the bill originally drafted by Cruz. The passage of the Senate's standalone no-tax-on-tips measure occurred ahead of the House's passage of the broader tax package favored by Republicans and President Donald Trump, which also includes a temporary no-tax-on-tips provision. Despite those distinctions, economists have put the cost of the measure at about $10 billion in foregone tax revenue per year. TRUMP AND CRUZ'S 'NO TAX ON TIPS' PLAN PASSES SENATE WITH UNEXPECTED HELP FROM DEM The standalone No Tax on Tips Act would create a new, permanent federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000 for cash tips for eligible employees working in jobs that receive tips ""traditionally and customarily"" based on a definition to be established by the Treasury Department. Eligible workers would have to earn less than $160,000 in 2025, a figure that would be adjusted for inflation in the years ahead. While the Senate's standalone bill would make the change permanent, the provision in the House bill is similar, though it's scheduled to sunset after four years. Congress often makes tax or spending provisions temporary because the budgetary impact scores lower and can thus help lawmakers comply with rules that limit the deficit impact of bills considered through the reconciliation process. A recent analysis of the no-tax-on-tips legislation by the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation, as part of a broader look at the House's ""One Big, Beautiful Bill"" tax package, found that the provision would cost about $40 billion in foregone tax revenue over a decade, with costs at $10 billion a year for four years before sunsetting. NEW PROJECTION SIGNALS GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, WORKERS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Brett Loper, executive vice president of policy at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, told FOX Business that the provision is unlikely to have a significant impact on economic growth given the modest relief it provides to a relatively small subset of the U.S. workforce. ""I think this would have a negligible impact on the economy. You're talking about a very small number of workers who would be eligible for it, something like 1.7% of the workforce, and the amount of tax reduction they're going to get is relatively modest,"" Loper said. ""I think you could make arguments that, for any benefit that you would have from those individuals having additional take-home pay, you could point to the additional cost of maintaining that much more debt that the government's going to have to issue in order to cover this un-offset tax provision."" Loper added that Congress has ""an almost infinite number of ways in which other revenue can be found to offset these types of provisions, and the Senate isn't doing it, and the House, while they have a slightly different approach with a limit of four years, they're not doing it either. In both cases, we're just deficit-financing tax cuts."" GIG ECONOMY TITANS UBER, DOORDASH BACK TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' IN CAPITOL HILL PUSH The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) looked at the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act and estimated a cost of $100 billion or more over a decade, which CRFB President Maya MacGuineas criticized for adding to the national debt. ""Exasperated doesn't even begin to do it. This most recent vote to deliver no tax on tips is especially egregious since it shows that the only thing the United States Senate appears to be able to agree on unanimously is that they want to deliver more tax cuts and totally disregard the potential impact on the national debt, which we estimate could be upwards of $100 billion or more over a decade,"" MacGuineas said. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE ""Not only is this policy expensive, but it also benefits one specific group and is not how we should be going about designing tax policy,"" she added. ""The whole point of tax reform is to reduce carve-outs and expand the tax base, not narrow it further by giving specific industries handouts.""

He’s talked with many people who are living paycheck to paycheck, but this recent call presented a rare case. The caller has $27k in debt despite bringing in $170k per year as a political consultant. It sounds like he should have enough money to cover his credit card debt, but a few bad money habits have caused the debt to reach its current level. It ultimately comes down to his mindset, and Ramsey shares some ways the caller can change his finances. Key Points A caller told Dave Ramsey that he earns $170k per year but has $27k in credit card debt. Ramsey explains the mindset you need to have if you want to get out of debt.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Getting the Entire Story While a $170k income looks like more than enough to cover a $27k debt on paper, there are a lot of details that paint a more clear picture. The caller has only been earning $170k per year for six months. He was previously unemployed due to the pandemic and made $90k per year at his previous job. He worked as an Uber driver and brought in a $20k annual income before landing the political consultant job. However, he’s also making a bunch of bad financial decisions. He’s renting cars instead of buying a used car and also spends $3,200 per month on rent between New York and Florida. He splits his time between both of those states because of his job requirements. However, he’s also covering his girlfriend’s expenses because she’s out of work. Dave called him out on this since he initially implied that they were splitting the rent. The financial guru suggested that the caller shouldn’t subsidize the girlfriend’s life and should ask her to contribute to the rent. The caller knows he has to fix his finances. That’s good since awareness is the first step to solving any problem. Now, it comes down to knowing what you have to do and completing those tasks. You Have to Get Sick and Tired of Being Sick and Tired Dave told the caller that he has to get sick and tired of being sick and tired to meaningfully change his finances. The caller is smart, as he was able to secure a job that pays $170k per year. Dave mentions this fact, but he also states that the caller is making foolish decisions with his money. This context makes it clear that the caller is smart enough to develop financial discipline if push comes to shove. While some people wait for a rock bottom moment, Ramsey has a different suggestion. He tells the caller to think as if he will die on Christmas if he doesn’t repay the $27k debt. It’s an extreme measure, but having that type of urgency would suddenly cause the caller to become financially disciplined. Of course, this is just an imaginary scenario, but having some type of deadline in place can lead to better decisions. These insights can help the caller with their finances, but there are many variables involved in finances. It’s good to speak with a financial advisor and create a budget that works if possible. Having a mentor by your side can make it easier to bolster your financial discipline and get on the right track.

UBER,2025-03-03 12:31:02,Has Tipping Gotten Out of Hand? Here Are the Current Social Rules,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/has-tipping-gotten-out-of-hand-here-are-the-20250303.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"If you live in the United States and polled 100 people about something financial that has gotten out of hand lately, I hope tipping is the top answer. We now live in a world where businesses that would have never dreamed of asking for a tip, like a clothing retailer, ask for tips with every transaction. Key Points For better or worse, the tipping culture in America isn’t going anywhere. The reality is that the rise of digital checkouts has only made tipping more pervasive wherever you shop. There are some absolute rules and general guidelines for how much to leave as a tip. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) The massive shift in tipping culture now begs the question of what the new social rules should be. What is the proper etiquette in different establishments? When should or shouldn’t you leave a tip? Unfortunately, the answer isn’t so easy. 20. Why Has Tipping Changed? Many places seem to blame the pandemic as tipping became integral to supporting essential workers. However, one of the more logical reasons is the rise of digital payment systems, which can display a tipping option right in front of customers before they complete their transaction. This has made it easy for businesses to make tipping a focal point of every purchase. 19. What Do Americans Really Think? Most discussions around the tipping culture change point back to a 2023 Pew Research poll that indicates over one-third of all Americans feel it’s “very easy” to know when to tip. Conversely, an equal number of people also claimed that they found it “not too easy or not at all easy” when asked if they know how much to tip in certain situations. Of the 12,000 respondents, 72% indicated they were being asked to tip more frequently than in the past. 18. Is Tipping Here To Say? By all accounts, tipping isn’t going anywhere, and we shouldn’t expect it to disappear overnight. Restaurants could start building the cost of tipping into their prices to pay servers a fair wage, but then higher food prices would turn away customers, so this isn’t a solution. While other countries may not rely so heavily on tipping, expect the US to rely on it for the foreseeable future. 17. Miscellaneous Roles Unsurprisingly, there are a host of roles where a tip might be something you consider but is not required. This might be a job like an exterminator, carpet installer, or window washer. Generally, $10 or $20 is acceptable in these cases, but you don’t need to exceed this number. In the case of a camp counselor or teacher, pool together money with the rest of the parents and provide one significant gift. 16. House Movers If you are moving homes, whether down the street or across the country, these individuals are lifting a lot, and potentially even packing for you. As a result, your tip should be hefty enough to make it meaningful, which is why 15% to 20% of the total move cost is appropriate. 15. Coat Check If you are in a place where a coat check is used, the acceptable norm is likely to be between $1 per coat and $2 if you have a bag. 14. Hotel Housekeeper This isn’t one of those roles that generally gets a tip as sometimes you may never see housekeepers’ work. However, if you can tip a housekeeper in a hotel, the rule of thumb is around $5 per night. 13. Salon At the salon, whether it’s a hair stylist, manicurist, or someone who provides facials, the same general rule is likely to apply. Upwards of 15% to 20% is the socially acceptable norm for any of these roles. 12. Baggage Handler At an airport or hotel, if you are providing your luggage to someone at the curb or inside a hotel lobby, it’s appropriate to generally tip around $1 to $2 per bag, depending on the number of bags. The same rule applies if you also hand your bags to someone at a cruise port. 11. Uber Drivers This applies to both Uber and Lyft, but this is another instance where the proper etiquette would be around 20% of the ride total. You might want to up this amount during a busy time like a concert or sports game where traffic is worse. 10. Grocery Delivery If you use something like Shipt or Walmart+ and have your groceries delivered, someone took a lot of time to get everything you wanted on your list. This is why experts say that 15% or 20% of the order total is the least you can tip. 9. Meal Delivery This is a controversial one as it depends on the kind of delivery driver. Your Amazon delivery driver? No tip is required, but the argument changes if it’s someone from DoorDash or GrubHub. This role is highly dependent on tips, and, as a result, you should tip around 20% or $5, depending on whichever is greater. 8. Coffee Shops This is a tough one because it depends on whether a tip is included on a screen or, in the case of a Starbucks, in a jar sitting at the register. Ideally, experts recommend as much as 15% of the cost of your coffee or latte. Even sticking a dollar in the jar is a welcome gesture. 7. Car Valet If you need a valet for your car at a shopping mall, restaurant, or airport, tipping in this space is expected. Ideally, experts say you should plan to do between $2 and $5 when your car is returned. 6. Babysitter While babysitters might make an agreed-upon hourly wage that varies based on the age of the child and the number of children, tips are not uncommon. Parents who want to keep a babysitter returning regularly should focus on rounding up any totals to try and add a little more to the balance to show appreciation. 5. Tour Guide This is a challenging one because it really depends on how much work the tour guide puts into the tour. A full-day tour? This should have a larger tip than someone who spends an hour working with you. Still, figure between 10 and 20% of the cost. 4. Bar Tabs Generally speaking, if you tip a bartender after closing out a bar tab or even just paying for one drink, think anywhere between 15% and 20% of the total. 3. Spa Services Another important tipping location is for spa service providers, who have long depended on tips as part of their wages. In these cases, experts tend to agree that 20% of the total cost of the spa day is appropriate. 2. Group Dining This is a tough one, as not every restaurant includes a separate check. However, whether you pay as a group with cash or get checks individually, the tip should reflect the same percentage. In other words, it should be roughly 20% of your portion of the bill. 1. Restaurant Tipping In one of the few business types where tipping is not only okay but expected, the same general longstanding amount rules continue to apply. On average, it’s recommended to tip between 18% and 20% of the total bill (including tax). So a $100 restaurant check would require a $20 tip or more, depending on the level of service.

Police said Tuesday they were called at around noon to a home on North Pearl Street in rural Kankakee. The homeowner told police a man posing as an Uber Eats delivery driver came to the front door. As the homeowner was speaking with him, two other men forced their way inside, the sheriff's office said. They restrained the homeowner with zip ties then ransacked the home, stealing electronics, cash, and multiple firearms including handguns and rifles before fleeing the scene. After an investigation, sheriff's police arrested three suspects linked to the home invasion. Arrested were Marcus A. Phelan, 41, of Kankakee, James E. Schoeberl II, 38, of St. Anne, and Ryan A. McManimen, 29, of Bourbonnais. All three were charged with home invasion. Phelan, who was armed at the time of his arrest, was taken into custody on an outstanding warrant out of Morgan County, Illinois. Sheriff's deputies recovered multiple stolen items during the arrests. ""I want to commend our investigators for their outstanding work in quickly identifying and apprehending these individuals,"" Sheriff Mike Downey said. ""The ability to recover stolen property—including dangerous firearms—and bring these suspects into custody so swiftly is a testament to their dedication."" Downey also thanked the Kankakee police and fire departments, the Kankakee County Emergency Response Team, and the Kankakee County State's Attorney's Office for their help.

His appearances on the TV shows Saturday Night Live and The Big Bang Theory personalized his odd sense of humor. Musk is most known as the CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and its rise to becoming the biggest auto manufacturer by market capitalization was nothing short of amazing. Tesla’s IPO was on June 29, 2010 for $17 per share, or roughly $1 when adjusting for stock splits. To put into perspective how much the company has grown since 2010, a $1,000 investment would be worth $203,244.61 today, based on the current share price of $320.72. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, and 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther-looking insights based on Tesla’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Tesla has managed to thrive and boost earnings and revenues even in high-interest climates. Tesla has continued to generate record revenues in spite of softness in the EV industry due to its vertically integrated expansion into related sectors. Besides EVs, Tesla has a robust and profitable battery and storage division, 6,000 locations, a growing chain of charging stations across the US, and a menu of AI developments large enough to qualify it for analyst inclusion in the AI category. Tesla’s Full Self Driving (FSD) AI-powered driverless cars are getting closer to an actual launch for Tesla’s Robotaxi, which would dramatically impact the transportation industry.

One company is a ‘10X Moonshot’ that could become the dominant software play in AI. Tesla Stock News and Updates 11/18/2024 A recent study by iSeeCars has raised concerns about the safety of Tesla vehicles, particularly the Model Y and Model S. Based on NHTSA data, the research indicates that these models have much higher fatality rates compared to the average car. While Tesla vehicles have been known for their advanced safety features, the recent study suggests that the use of Autopilot and Full-Self Driving systems may lead to great driver distraction, contributing to greater risks on the road. 11/15/2024 Billionaire investor Ron Baron has shared that he believes Tesla could skyrocket to a $5 trillion market cap within the next decade. 11/14/2024 Tesla has issued another recall on its electric cybertruck. This is the sixth recall just this year. The defect could potentially cause a loss of driver power, but the company says they will fix it for free. 11/12/2024 Tesla will be releasing a “2024 Holiday” update that promises to improve driving capabilities and overall vehicle safety for winter. The update aims to address cold weather issues and introduce new features for a positive user experience. 11/11/2024 Tesla’s shares continue to soar and are currently at the highest level the company has seen since April 2022. 11/8/2024 According to recent reports, Elon Musk was part of two important calls made by President-elect Donald Trump this week. Musk allegedly spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 11/7/2024 Tesla’s shares continue to ride high following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. In just five days, the company’s shares have soared 20% to hit a new all-time high of over $298. This added $15 to Elon Musk’s net worth, boosting his fortune to an estimated $280.3 billion. 11/6/2024 Tesla’s stock rose 15% today following the U.S. presidential election. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, has been a public supporter of President Trump and has even campaigned with him recently. 11/5/2024 Elon Musk has openly endorsed former President Donald Trump in the recent presidential election. Investors have expressed concerns as to how Tesla’s stock then, may be affected if Trump does not ultimately return to office. Analysts predict that there may be a short slump in Tesla’s stock, but in the long run, it will remain steady. 11/4/2024 Tesla is building an enormous new Supercharger station in Central California with 168 stalls. This will be one of the largest Supercharger stations in the world. It will be located off Interstate 5 at W. Jayne Avenue. 5 to 10 Year Review Tesla’s Supercharger chain of recharging stations numbered 6,000 as of January 2024, in comparison to DOT’s pathetic 7 at a much higher per station cost. After some messy beginnings, which wound up with Musk taking control of Tesla from founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, Musk spearheaded additional fundraising rounds in order to produce the Tesla Roadster. The Roadster’s initial sales were sufficient market proof for Tesla to go public. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its top line by 44% and EBITDA by 74%, advocating long-term growth and strong fundamentals. Tesla’s progress would hit the following milestones, leading it into profitability in 2020, and never looking back since. EV: The Model S became the best-selling plug-in electric car in both 2015 and 2016. The mass-market Model 3 sedan would follow, and the Model 3 would become the best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021. The Model Y mass-market SUV version of the Model 3 would make its debut in 2019, with deliveries commencing in 2020. Energy Storage &amp; Gathering: Entering the energy storage market in 2015, Tesla released its rechargeable Powerwall lithium-ion home storage battery and Megapack in 2019, which was designed for large-scale businesses and utility projects. It acquired SolarCity in 2016 for its battery technology to become a key part of its subsidiary Tesla Energy. Tesla Glass became a subsidiary, specifically for providing the glass roofs supplied with the Model 3 and for Tesla’s Solar Shingle panels for solar energy gathering. Charging Stations: Tesla addressed the dearth of charging stations by establishing its North American Charging Standard (NASC). Now known as SAE J3400, NACS has since been adopted by all EV manufacturers in North America for the sake of uniformity, much like the Universal Serial Bus (USB) for computers. Tesla’s Supercharger networks, which launched in 2012, have since expanded to 6,000 stations with 55,000 chargers worldwide as of the beginning of 2024. Fiscal Year Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $16.00 $4.046B -$888.7M 2016 $14.25 $7.000B -$674.9M 2017 $21.60 $11.759B -$1.962B 2018 $21.18 $21.461B -$976M 2019 $29.53 $24.578B -$862M 2020 $235.23 $31.536B $721M 2021 $352.26 $53.823B $5.519B 2022 $123.18 $81.462B $12.556B 2023 $248.48 $96.773B $14.997B 2024 (LTM) $209.21 $95.318B $12.338B Key Drivers for Tesla’s Future Tesla’s Shanghai gigafactory built EVs are made to compete head-to-head with Chinese EVs from manufacturers like Nio. Tesla’s management is cutting manufacturing costs and improving margins, trending with strong revenue and net income gains since 2020. Its Shanghai, China, and Berlin, Germany gigafactories should help Tesla cut a chunk of export-related red tape and tariffs for forthcoming EVs that will result in lower overseas sticker prices and enhanced sales. Thanks to its R&amp;D with FSD and Robotaxis, Tesla is leading nicely ahead of GM’s Cruise and Alphabet’s Waymo. Chinese companies like Apollo Go and WeRide are viewed as better-equipped Robotaxi competitors, in a field that may explode in the upcoming future. Some analysts believe that the Optimus program has been unfairly judged and that its contributions to Tesla will result in additional revenue boosts. Tesla’s Supercharger, energy, and battery businesses have taken off strongly and further separated it from its EV peers as a company with many more technology irons in the fire. Musk’s further development of Grok and X.AI will ostensibly benefit Tesla with cutting-edge AI tools, keeping its competitive advantage over other automobile rivals trying to incorporate AI into their own cars. EV tariffs, regulations, and shifting geopolitical policies and legislation are factors beyond Tesla’s control that can impact the company as well as the EV industry. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 Tesla’s R&amp;D in large storage batteries extends beyond EV use to be marketed also for utility and other large-scale industrial applications. The consensus 12-month price target for Tesla from over 50 different analysts is $212.00 per share, which would calculate year-over-year growth estimates at -33.90%. The analysts are mixed: 11 of them rated Tesla a “buy”, 5 were “outperform”, 20 were “hold”, 4 were “underperform”, and 7 pessimists gave Tesla a “sell” recommendation. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month Tesla price projection is $213.20, which would be a -33.52% loss. The mixed opinions likely stem from the unconventional way that Musk runs not only Tesla, but all of his companies. Fears over the potential for a domino effect, if negative events impact one to cause a spillover effect due to his mercurial temperament, are not unfounded. The latter part of 2024 and 2025 looks to be an exciting period for Tesla. The much ballyhooed Robotaxi unveiling has been bumped to October 2024 (although this can wind up even later in 2024 or early 2025, as Musk is notorious for missing date targets). Additionally, Tesla’s FSD version 12.5 will also make its debut. In order to prime the pump to improve acceptability for its autonomous vehicles, Tesla management has already cut the price of FSD (Supervised) in North America and has launched free trials for interested parties. Additionally, Tesla management gave guidance in its July earnings report that the vehicle volume growth rate in 2024 “may be notably lower than the growth rate” last year. The EV giant added that growth in its energy storage business, driven by the buzz over its new 4680 battery cell, which improves vehicle range and lowers costs, should outpace its automotive segment. That trend will likely reverse and balance out in 2025. Tesla’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook 2026: Tesla is also looking to become a major player in other parts of the world. It will have to compete with firms like Nissan, Ford, General Motors, VW, Toyota, Nio, and Xpeng to either become the leaders or stay at the top of the EV market in these areas. Tesla’s Shanghai and Berlin gigafactories were built in 2018 and 2019 to circumvent tariffs and other import obstacles in China and Europe. It appears that Musk’s vision for mass production automation has become a reality in China, where Shanghai gigafactory automation is reportedly up to 95%, and the Berlin gigafactory is building both Tesla Model-Y EVs and batteries at this time. The two factories should be both at full capacity by 2026. EV output should allow Tesla to avoid Chinese and European tariffs, as well as create enough surplus inventory for export to other countries. In fact, the E.U.’s tariff on Chinese EVs has a discount for Chinese-made Model Y imports. Tesla’s Berlin factory is facing some regional friction over the factory’s effect on the environment, with reports of heavy deforestation and water pollution. Tesla will likely need to rectify matters with the German government before it can ramp up to match the China gigafactory’s projections. Assuming that these issues are resolved, 2026 is expected to see Tesla take a jump to $264.20, a -17.62% loss. 2027: Robotics development became an obvious decision as mass production ramped up, although Tesla’s experience was not without its own minefields. One new creation from its robotics work was the Tesla Bot, dubbed “Optimus”. Musk’s enthusiasm for the potential of Optimus is enormous. He stated in the Q2 2024 report some of the following comments: “I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined…I suspect that the long-term demand for general-purpose humanoid robots is in excess of 20 billion units. And Tesla is — that has the most advanced humanoid robot in the world, and is also very good at manufacturing, which these other companies are not…my rough estimate long-term market cap is on the order of $5 trillion for — maybe more for autonomous transport, and it’s several times that number for general purpose humanoid robots….It’s a wild — very wild future we’re heading for.” The projected commercialization launch of Optimus will likely be 1 of 2 major breakthroughs for Tesla in 2027. The other will be a push towards an official full-scale Robotaxi production and distribution. ARK Invest’s Cathie Woods believes it will start in 2025, but regulatory obstacles will likely not allow it to fully launch until 2027. As a result, EPS is expected to jump almost 50%. A projected price of $393.60 would be a +129 point gain. 2028-29: Cathie Woods also predicted that as much as 90% of Tesla’s enterprise value and earnings will be attributed to the Robotaxi business by 2028-29. This prediction may anticipate a possibility of Uber and Lyft becoming clients or partners, rather than rivals. Musk’s Supercharger network is crucial to the success of a Robotaxi industry in the U.S. since Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttiigieg has basically spent over $1 billion each on just (7) DOT-built recharging stations to date. This is a huge strategic leverage that Tesla can exercise in its favor. In the same period, battery developments, and lower-cost budget EVs should also see releases. 2028’s price target of $392.50 and 2029 at $400.50. Tesla stock in 2030 If Tesla can navigate successfully though the domestic and international regulatory hurdles, 24.7 Wall Street calculates Tesla stock will see a 124% gain in 5 years. Assuming that Tesla is successful in navigating international expansion and can weather the geopolitical issues, the company may realize sufficient diversification in its robotics, AI, energy, and taxi businesses to reduce its current 84% reliance on EVs for its revenues. With the growth trajectories anticipated from these various operational segments, a 2030 all-time high price of $470.00 is in order.
