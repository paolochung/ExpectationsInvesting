(NASDAQ: TSLA) is in two businesses. One is electric vehicles (EVs) and the other is energy and storage. Energy and storage revenue rose 67% in the past quarter to $2.7 billion. That is well under auto revenue, but EV revenue was down 20% to $14 billion. The energy and storage segment has an impressive cost of revenue of $1.9 billion. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) electric vehicle sales are on the decline. It may have to depend on its energy and storage business to prop up earnings in the meantime. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Energy Storage News reports that “the segment provides products for both residential and large-scale energy storage. This includes the Powerwall for homes, the Powerpack for businesses, and the Megapack for utilities and large-scale projects.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented in late 2024 that the storage business was “growing like a wildfire.” The energy and storage business will not surpass EV sales, but it might provide most of Tesla’s operating income in the short term. This is similar to what AWS did for Amazon when its core e-commerce business slowed. Tesla needs to be able to produce a positive net income, particularly if its EV sales continue to decline. In Europe in May, sales dropped by double-digit percentages year over year. In China, the world’s largest EV market, sales fell 15%. Tesla does not report U.S. sales, but there is a good chance they declined in May as well. Tesla is counting on its AI-driven products to push its share price back up. It launches its self-driving robotaxi in Texas this month. Its success or failure could move the stock price in the near term. In the meantime, Tesla has a rapidly growing division that could prop up Tesla&#8217;s earnings.

Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign down 16%, and Broadcom is down 4%. So, perhaps its not surprising that after initial gains of 6%, shares of Rubrick are now flat after-hours as of 5:05 p.m. ET. The company still has its earnings call, but after a furious rally in stocks across the past two months, expectations for earnings have clearly risen. Shares Surge on Strong Earnings 4:34 pm by Joel South Shares of RBRK soared in after-hours trading after reporting strong Q1 results. The stock is up 6.02% since the close. Rubrik kicked off its FY 2026 with impressive Q1 results, exceeding all guided metrics and showcasing strong growth across key areas. The cyber resilience company reported a 49% year-over-year revenue increase to $278.5 million and a 38% rise in subscription annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $1.18 billion. The company now has 2,381 customers generating over $100K in subscription ARR, up 28% from the prior year. CEO Bipul Sinha credited the results to focused innovation and execution, while CFO Kiran Choudary highlighted ongoing progress toward profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin improved to 80.5%, and free cash flow turned positive at $33.3 million. Rubrik also announced major partnerships with Google Cloud, Deloitte, NTT Data and Rackspace to expand its data protection and AI security offerings. Looking ahead, Rubrik projects Q2 revenue between $281 million and $283 million and expects full-year revenue to reach up to $1.19 billion. Risks 3:32 pm 1. Channel Saturation and GTM Efficiency PressureRubrik is scaling fast, but sales and marketing spend remains high. If CAC payback extends or sales cycles elongate — especially in regulated verticals — investors may question whether the growth is too expensive. High cash burn without operating leverage risks a rerating, even if ARR expands. 2. Competitive Intensity and Pricing RiskRubrik competes with Veeam, Cohesity, and emerging vendors — many with lower-cost backup offerings. While Rubrik has positioned itself as a premium, AI-native cyber recovery platform, pricing pressure could emerge in mid-market deals or renewals. Any sign of discounting or ASP compression would undercut gross margin confidence. 3. Reliance on Cloud PartnershipsRubrik’s Microsoft and AWS integrations are strengths — but also dependencies. If those partners pivot product strategy, shift co-selling alignment, or prioritize their own tools, Rubrik’s funnel could be disrupted. Partner fatigue or shifting incentives are execution risks not fully priced in. 4. IPO Transition and Reporting ScrutinyAs a newly public company, Rubrik must now meet the rigor of quarterly financial scrutiny. Any inconsistency in disclosure, slippage in RPO, or misalignment between growth and margin could trigger outsized stock reactions. Execution discipline — not just topline growth — will define Rubrik’s post-IPO multiple. Keys to Watch 3:31 pm 1. ARR Growth Trajectory and Large Deal MixWith ~$784M in ARR entering Q1, the Street expects Rubrik to exit FY25 on a ~$1B ARR run-rate. Key to this is continued growth in $1M+ ARR customers and large enterprise wins. Investors will be looking for sequential adds in that cohort, as well as commentary on deal cycles and retention. 2. Microsoft Partnership ActivationRubrik’s GTM alignment with Microsoft — particularly around Azure and Office 365 data protection — is seen as a key differentiator. This quarter, investors want evidence that joint field activity is translating to pipeline conversion, particularly in mid-market and public sector verticals. Deal attribution commentary will be closely parsed. 3. Gross Margin Stability and Product ExpansionLast reported gross margin was 78%, among the highest in SaaS. If this holds or improves, it supports the long-term model of Rubrik as a profitable security platform. Management may offer commentary on adoption of new SKUs — including sensitive data classification and policy automation tools — which could lift ASP and reduce churn. 4. RPO Conversion and Billing PatternsRubrik’s RPO grew 55% YoY last reported, and Q1 is expected to show how much of that is converting to near-term revenue. Investors will track deferred revenue build and renewal velocity to assess whether the business is front-loaded or recurring. Clean billings execution would reinforce ARR confidence. Consensus Estimates 3:30 pm Q1 FY2025 Street Estimates: Revenue: $187.2M (+38% YoY) Adjusted EPS: –$0.33 Gross Margin: ~78% Adj. EBITDA: –$32.4M ARR (prior disclosed): $784M Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO): $811M Growth Metrics to Watch: $1M+ ARR Customers: 117 last reported (+66% YoY) Net Revenue Retention: ~120% Multi-product adoption rate: &gt;50% The Street expects Rubrik to sustain strong revenue momentum into Q2, with guide implications pointing to $200M+ quarterly run-rate before year-end. Analysts are looking for updates to customer count, upsell trends, and vertical-specific traction, particularly in public sector, healthcare, and regulated industries. Cash burn will remain elevated — EBITDA losses are expected near $30M+ — but the focus is on narrowing those losses quarter over quarter while maintaining high ARR expansion and multi-product attach rates. Any progress toward FCF breakeven or improved CAC payback would be viewed as a sign of operational maturity. Rubrik enters its first earnings release as a public company with significant expectations baked into its valuation and narrative. The cybersecurity and data resilience platform is positioned as a high-growth, cloud-native alternative to legacy backup and recovery vendors — and the Street is watching closely to see whether that pitch holds up under public scrutiny. Consensus expects $187.2M in revenue (+38% YoY) and an adjusted EPS loss of –$0.33, sharply improved from –$1.58 YoY. The quarter will test Rubrik’s ability to maintain hypergrowth while narrowing losses and will serve as the first checkpoint for public market investors to evaluate execution quality, GTM leverage, and forward ARR visibility. Management previously disclosed ARR of $784M and 55% YoY growth in RPO. This quarter is expected to show continued traction in large enterprise deals — especially those tied to Microsoft cloud workloads. A key test will be whether customers adopting Rubrik Security Cloud are scaling usage and adding modules such as threat detection, compliance auditing, and ransomware response automation. Given Rubrik’s premium valuation and compressed FCF profile, execution on both growth and efficiency must be crisp. Investors will seek signals that sales productivity is improving, gross margins remain near 78%, and that runway remains long even as growth decelerates modestly from IPO-era acceleration.

AMZN,2025-06-06 10:43:48,Broadcom (AVGO) Earnings Live: What To Expect From 2Q Results,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/broadcom-avgo-earnings-live-what-to-expect-from-2q-20250606.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call is Starting Now 5:07 pm by Joel South Broadcom&#8217;s conference call is starting now. You can listen in here if you&#8217;d like. The stock is currently down 3.4%. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that almost every major stock reporting tonight is seeing red after-hours. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign is down 16%, and Rubrik jumped 6% after its earnings were released. However, its shares are now flat. Translation: After a furious two-month stock market rally, investors expectations for what companies should be delivering has risen. If any material news impacts Broadcom&#8217;s share price during its conference call we&#8217;ll post an update. One Standout Figure from Broadcom&#039;s Earnings 4:41 pm by Eric Bleeker One figure to pay attention to is that Broadcom is guiding to AI revenue next quarter of $5.1 billion, that&#8217;s above Wall Street&#8217;s expectations of $4.8 billion. Keep in mind that Broadcom&#8217;s stock has moved significantly in recent quarters based on conference call commentary, so where it&#8217;s trading right now (-2.5%) could be very different than where it opens tomorrow if the company&#8217;s CEO gives some especially bullish comments about future AI demand. It&#039;s a Beat and Raise for Broadcom - So Why Aren&#039;t Shares Moving? 4:37 pm by Joel South Broadcom issued a beat and raise for tonight&#8217;s earnings, not only surpassing last quarter&#8217;s expectations from Wall Street, but also topping guidance. So why aren&#8217;t the share moving north after-hours? Simply put, Broadcom has rallied a remarkable 78% since April 4th, so plenty of optimism was built in headed into these earnings. A slight beat and guide for the coming quarter above consensus is generally expected when stocks have rallied as furiously as Broadcom has in recent months. Make no mistake, Broadcom&#8217;s quarter was solid and its guidance for next quarter points to continuing momentum. However, the results are also not far enough above consensus to move the needle much after Broadcom&#8217;s recent run. Broadcom Shares are Rebounding 4:29 pm by Joel South Broadcom shares are rebounding, now roughly flat after initially dropping several percent after the company&#8217;s earnings release. Shares Slide Despite Record Q2 Results on Surging AI Demand 4:26 pm by Joel South Broadcom posted strong Q2 results, with revenue climbing 20% year-over-year to a record $15 billion, fueled by rapid growth in AI semiconductor demand and contributions from VMware. The company reported GAAP net income of $5 billion and non-GAAP net income of $7.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 35% to $10.0 billion, representing 67% of revenue. AI revenue reached $4.4 billion in Q2, up 46% from the previous year, and is projected to grow further to $5.1 billion in Q3. CEO Hock Tan noted continued investment from hyperscale partners and 10 straight quarters of AI revenue growth. Broadcom also generated $6.4 billion in free cash flow, returning $7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. The company expects Q3 revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and maintains strong profitability guidance. Despite this, shares slipped in after-hour trading 28.6% from the close. Execution Risks 3:33 pm by Joel South Despite strong momentum, Broadcom’s Q2 setup is not without potential downside risks. The most immediate is hyperscaler AI capex cyclicality. While demand remains strong, cloud buildouts can be lumpy, and any signal of Q3 digestion or budget reallocation — especially in networking — could imply slower sequential growth, even if the long-term trajectory remains intact. On the software side, customer churn within VMware remains a meaningful risk. Broadcom’s go-to-market changes — including consolidation of SKUs and tighter bundling — could alienate long-time customers, especially in segments like EUC (End-User Computing) that are being divested or deemphasized. If bookings slow or renewal rates dip below plan, the market may question whether VMware revenue is truly durable. Another issue is regulatory scrutiny and deal pipeline constraints. Broadcom has long relied on M&amp;A to build scale and pricing power. But with global regulators now increasingly aggressive, further transformative acquisitions could face long timelines or outright rejection, limiting long-term inorganic growth potential. Finally, valuation has expanded significantly. The stock trades at ~25x forward EPS — toward the high end of its historical range. That leaves limited room for error on the Q2 results or full-year guide. If margins contract, or if guidance remains unchanged despite tailwinds, the bar may prove too high. Keys to Watch 3:32 pm by Joel South 1. GenAI Ethernet Momentum and ASP Trends:The durability of Broadcom’s AI networking tailwind is the single most important question heading into this release. Investors want to know if demand from hyperscalers is accelerating, stabilizing, or softening — and whether AVGO is gaining share vs. InfiniBand-based alternatives like Nvidia’s Mellanox stack. A beat in networking and bullish comments on demand visibility into 2H FY24 would reinforce Broadcom’s role as a backbone infrastructure supplier for AI training and inference clusters. 2. VMware Margins, Churn, and Booking Signals:While headline growth will be boosted by VMware consolidation, investors care more about how profitable those dollars are. If VMware segment operating margin exceeds 60% or gross margin trends toward the high-70s, the software synergy thesis gains credibility. Watch closely for commentary on customer renewals, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), and any soft patches in product overlap areas. 3. Guidance Lift and Fiscal Discipline:Management has guided conservatively over the past year, often beating internally restrained expectations. If Broadcom raises its full-year revenue outlook to $51B or above and holds EBITDA margin at 60%, it would confirm confidence in both software execution and sustained AI spend. That could justify further multiple expansion in the mid-20x EPS range. Core Results &amp; Segment Highlights 3:31 pm by Joel South Q2 FY2024 Street Estimates: Revenue: $12.04B Adjusted EPS: $10.84 YoY Revenue Growth: +37.6% Adj. Gross Margin (guide): ~75% Adj. EBITDA Margin (guide): 60% FY24 (Implied): Full-Year Revenue Guide (prior): $50B AI Infrastructure Run-Rate (last disclosed): $1B/quarter VMware Contribution Estimate (Q2): ~$2.3B Legacy Semiconductor Core (ex-VMware): ~$9.7B Broadcom has beaten Street EPS estimates in each of the last 12 quarters. Last quarter, it reported EPS of $10.99 on $11.96B in revenue, exceeding guidance on both lines and attributing the strength primarily to AI-related Ethernet demand and an unexpectedly smooth start to VMware integration. This quarter, analysts are expecting flat-to-up sequential trends in networking, mid-single-digit growth in broadband, and mid-teens growth in wireless — all consistent with seasonal patterns. Software is expected to rise sharply YoY due to VMware, but investors will differentiate between organic Broadcom software and new VMware revenue. Most expect VMware to contribute &gt;$2B per quarter with 70–75% gross margin and 55–60% EBITDA margin — if Broadcom delivers higher, that would confirm synergy realization is ahead of pace. Notably, guidance will carry more weight than the headline numbers. Street models are anticipating an update to full-year revenue closer to $51B and potential EBITDA upside if VMware cost actions flow through earlier than planned. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) enters its Q2 FY2024 earnings release as one of the most closely watched semiconductor and infrastructure software plays, sitting squarely at the intersection of two defining technology narratives: hyperscale AI infrastructure deployment and large-scale software consolidation. Expectations are high across the board, and the stock has reflected that enthusiasm — surging over 30% in the past month to all-time highs, with investors pricing in both generative AI upside and a smooth VMware integration path. Analysts are modeling $12.04B in revenue (+37.6% YoY) and $10.84 in adjusted EPS, with roughly $2.3B expected from VMware in its first full quarter post-acquisition. The remainder of the growth is expected to come from AI-enabling components — especially Broadcom’s switch ASICs, custom silicon, and Ethernet fabric interconnects, which are widely deployed by hyperscale customers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The company previously disclosed that GenAI-related sales were running at a $1B quarterly pace — and any update on that figure will be a core focus. Broadcom’s results will serve as a high-stakes litmus test for enterprise AI infrastructure demand, especially given recent mixed signals from peers. Nvidia has flagged broad-based hyperscaler spend, while Marvell noted pushouts. Broadcom’s exposure is deeper in networking, and the expectation is for that segment to grow over 50% YoY, barring any cloud digestion pause. Just as important is the VMware narrative. Management previously guided to 60% EBITDA margins on a combined basis and expressed confidence that early cost synergies would materialize faster than expected. But as VMware customer contracts turn over, the Street wants proof that Broadcom can retain revenue while simplifying the product portfolio. Any sign of subscription churn or integration friction could undercut the broader software platform thesis.

Wall Street Bullish on This Big Tech Stock 9:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts have turned increasingly bullish on Amazon stock. Here&#8217;s a roundup of the most recent analyst moves: Earlier this week, BofA reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN and raised its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts highlighted Amazon’s advancements in robotics and AI, noting these could add approximately 2 percentage points to retail margins, supporting further upside. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating and increased its price target from $225 to $240. The firm emphasized Amazon’s leadership in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), along with margin tailwinds and a strong free cash flow (FCF) ramp, fueling a bullish long-term outlook. Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $240, noting that delays in Amazon’s Project Kuiper (satellite internet initiative) are expected and priced into the stock. They expressed confidence in Amazon’s 2025 launch cadence and cost guidance for the project. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain fickle, but today there is reason to be optimistic. Discussions have reemerged between the White House and Beijing, according to Chinese media reports. This has revived the &#8216;risk-on&#8217; trade and sent major stock market indices higher across the board. In a last-ditch effort, officials from both sides are trying to salvage trade talks that had previously stalled. Sectors of the economy are mixed today, with no clear conviction in either direction. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been capturing attention lately, most recently for announcing a $10 billion bet on AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock is up 1.7% today. Additionally, the markets are keeping an eye on the broader S&amp;P 500 index, which will announce changes to its member lineup on Friday. Bank of America has offered its two cents, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) could muscle their way into the index.

The markets remain unpredictable, and today is no exception. After starting out of the gate higher on trade talk hopes, stocks have since erased those gains. According to Chinese state media, talks have resumed between the White House and Beijing. In a final push, officials from both nations are attempting to rescue stalled trade negotiations. This appeared to have reignited the &#8220;risk-on&#8221; sentiment, but the markets have since taken a nosedive. Economic sectors are showing mixed signals today, lacking a decisive direction.

AMZN,2025-06-04 16:10:02,3 Small-Cap Dividend Stocks Under $50 With Big Potential,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/3-smallcap-dividend-stocks-under-50-with-big-potential-20250604.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the current market climate, investors are increasingly shifting to defensive strategies. As investors navigate the turbulent waters of tariff-driven volatility in 2025, dividend stocks have emerged as a safe harbor, delivering superior returns compared to the broader market. While the default strategy might be to anchor portfolios with blue-chip payers like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), smart money might also look to small-cap stocks. These smaller companies, typically with market caps under $2 billion, often possess untapped potential and the capacity for substantial upside due to their lower starting valuations. Our research has uncovered three intriguing small-cap dividend stocks, all trading below $50 per share, that appear poised for potential future appreciation. It&#8217;s true that small-cap investments come with elevated risk, but the potential rewards can be equally substantial. While we lack a crystal ball, these selected companies have demonstrated promising performance and attractive dividend yields. We acknowledge that some of these selections may have grown slightly beyond the conventional $2 billion small-cap threshold; however, their continued presence in prominent small-cap ETFs confirms their relevance to this segment. Key Points Kodiak Gas Services (KGS): High 5.1% yield, strong EBITDA growth, and analyst upgrades support potential return to 52-week highs. Buckle (BKE): Zero debt, rising same-store sales, and 16% margins make it a resilient small-cap retail dividend pick. Farmers National (FMNB): 5.1% yield, strong Q1 earnings growth, and expanding deposits highlight this undervalued small-cap bank’s upside. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Kodiak Gas Services (NYSE: KGS) There are a couple of reasons to like Kodiak Gas Services (NYSE: KGS) stock. At $36 per share, Kodiak offers a high dividend yield of 5.1%. Given its market capitalization of $3.1 billion, Kodiak is in the gray area for small-cap stocks but is included in Fidelity&#8217;s Small Cap Dividend Growth Fund. In Q2 2025, Kodiak announced an increase to its quarterly cash dividend to $0.45 per share, up 10% compared with Q4 2024 levels. If you were to purchase 100 shares of KGS stock at current levels and hold it for 10 years with DRIP, based on the latest performance, you could expect a total return of 57.3% as well as annual dividend income of $256.19. Over the past 12 months, Kodiak stock is up approximately 38.4%, though it continues to trade below its 52-week high of $50 per share. In its most recent quarterly results, Kodiak lifted the range of its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance in response to what management described as an &#8220;outstanding quarter.&#8221; With these positive catalysts, the stock could revisit recent highs sooner rather than later. Wall Street analysts are increasingly optimistic about Kodiak stock. Most recently, Stifel increased its price target on the stock by $1 to $46 per share with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating attached. The analyst firm said that despite an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, Kodiak is full speed ahead in the Permian basin, where it compresses natural gas for pipeline transportation. Buckle (NYSE: BKE) With a dividend yield of 3.2%, specialty retailer Buckle (NYSE: BKE) makes a quarterly distribution of $0.35 per share. The stock currently trades for approximately $42 per share, in the midpoint of its 52-week range. Wall Street analysts mostly advise holding the stock, with an average price target of $40 per share. The markets may be underappreciating BKE stock considering the company&#8217;s strong balance sheet. Buckle carries zero long-term debt. By purchasing 100 shares of BKE at current levels, and holding for 10 years with DRIP, you could expect annual dividend income of just over $191 and more than just a preservation of capital. Buckle recently reported a 6.1% jump in its same-store sales for the four-week period leading up to early May and has also been experiencing an increase in online sales. The company&#8217;s net sales in the same period increased 7% to $85.5 million. This performance is a shift from a tough 2024 in which revenues were on a downward trajectory. For example, in the first three quarters of 2024, Buckle suffered a 5% decline in revenues. But 2025 is off to a good start. In Q1, Buckle reported net income of $35.2 million, or $0.70 per share. Buckle competes with the likes of Target and Amazon but still manages an attractive profit margin of nearly 16%. If Buckle can keep up this performance, it might have further upside potential and could be worth a spot in a dividend investor&#8217;s portfolio. Farmers National (Nasdaq: FMNB) Canfield, Ohio-based Farmers National (Nasdaq: FMNB) stock trades for just over $13 per share. The company has a dividend yield of 5.1%. In May 2025, Farmers National recently declared its latest quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share. Wall Street has an average price target of $15 on Farmers National stock, reflecting upside potential of approximately 13%. FMNB stock is held by big institutions including BlackRock, Vanguard LSV Asset Management. With a purchase of 100 shares at current levels, and holding for 10 years with DRIP, you could expect annual dividend income of just over $111 and a total return of roughly 66% over that period. In Q1 2025, Farmers National reported net income of $13.6 million compared with $11.2 million year-over-year. Farmers National CEO Kevin Helmick described the bank&#8217;s &#8220;position of strength,&#8221; pointing to a &#8220;legacy of profitability, strong asset quality and robust liquidity levels&#8221; despite economic uncertainty. Farmers has growing customer deposits and has been expanding its footprint into new markets, the most recent of which was Columbus, Ohio. Investors who might want exposure to financial services might want to consider Farmers National for its steady dividend and potential for capital appreciation.

AMZN,2025-06-04 16:10:02,Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/palantir-technologies-nasdaq-pltr-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-20250604.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) gained 5.31% over the past five trading days, bringing its one-month gain to 6.21%. Year-to-date, the stock is up an eye-catching 74.53%, and over the past year, it has gained an absurd 495%. While the stock&#8217;s forward P/E ratio — currently 238.10 — can be concerning, Palantir&#8217;s federal contracts and aerospace ties are expected to continue fueling growth. While earnings are rear-facing, the emerging trends seen in the company&#8217;s Q1 results can serve as a foundation for further rewards for shareholders. In the first quarter, Palantir saw year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. U.S. commercial business surpassed a $1 billion run rate, good for 71% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year. PLTR&#8217;s market multiple implies it could take an investor nearly half a century to recover their initial investment, assuming earnings remained constant. But the assumption from the company — and from Wall Street analysts — is that earnings will continue to grow. EPS in Q1 2024, for example, stood at 8 cents, while EPS in Q1 2025 rose to 13 cents, good for an increase of 62.5%. So while there is concern about its valuation, what can investors expect from Palantir over the next year? 24/7 Wall St. did some analysis, so let’s take a look at. Key Points in This Article: Palantir&#8217;s government line of business accounts for more than half of its revenue, with existing contracts between the AI firm and the U.S. Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Agriculture, the FBI, the CDC, the U.S. Army and the UK&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, to name a handful. The company&#8217;s explosive commercial revenue growth shows that it is capable of sustainably scaling without being overly reliant upon federal contracts. It also provides services to numerous industries, including energy, data protection, health and life sciences, insurance, hospital operations, retail, semiconductors, telecommunications and utilities, among others.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Palantir? The AI environment is ripe for growth, though, of which Palantir should play a major part. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $1.811 trillion by the end of the decade, good for a 35.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2025 and 2030. The global market size of AI in 2024 was $279.2 billion, meaning at that forecasted CAGR, by the end of 2025, the market should expand to $379.4 billion. Companies like Palantir that focus on broad AI applications in diverse industries should see the lion&#8217;s share of that growth. This industry growth potential is one reason Palantir provided strong guidance in its Q1 earnings call, stating that it expects 36% revenue growth, with free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Not only has the company seen sizable growth, it forecasts sustainable momentum that will help continue that pattern over the course of the next year. Palantir’s government segment, which contributes 55% of revenue, grew 45% year-over-year in Q1 2025 to $373 million. High-profile contracts, like the recently signed ICE deal and NATO’s adoption of its AI-enabled military system, highlight its critical role in national security. President Trump&#8217;s emphasis on defense and government efficiency, exemplified by the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, positions Palantir as a go-to AI software provider, boosting investor confidence amid tariff-related market challenges. Additionally, the company&#8217;s commercial segment has skyrocketed, with U.S. commercial revenue up 71% year-over-year to $255 million in Q1 2025. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, empowers enterprises in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing to harness AI for data analytics. Strategic partnerships and 139 deals worth $1 million or more in Q1 (31 were over $10 million) demonstrate Palantir’s private-sector expansion, helping to drive stock gains. Palantir’s focus on operational efficiency has improved profitability, with adjusted operating margins expanding to 36% in Q1 2025 from 29% in 2024. Its software-as-a-service model, with high-margin recurring revenue, supports scalability across government and commercial clients. The company’s ability to deploy AIP rapidly, as shown by a 69% increase in customer count to 593, enhances revenue predictability. This profitability, coupled with $3.9 billion in cash reserves, fuels R&amp;D and market expansion, reinforcing investor optimism. Palantir (PLTR) as a Stock Since its IPO, Palantir has seen uncommon and exponential share appreciation, rising more than 1,300% since going public on Oct. 2, 2020. An enormous part of that growth came between February 2023 and February 2025, before the market began to correct this year. After reaching its all-time-high on Feb. 18, shares of PLTR fell by more than 40% before bottoming on April 4. But for patient, buy-and-hold investors, they have already been rewarded as the stock has pushed back up and established new all-time highs. Following the company&#8217;s Q1 earnings report, Royal Bank of Canada and Deutsche Bank reiterated their &#8220;Underperform&#8221; and &#8220;Sell&#8221; ratings, respectively, on the AI data analytics firm. Most other analysts, though, maintained their &#8220;Hold&#8221; ratings. A notable exception was Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a PLTR perma-bull who reiterated his buy call, saying Plantar is&#8221;one of our top tech names to own&#8221; and setting a $140 per share price target. Broadly, 18 Wall Street analysts assign the stock a consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating, with three analysts giving it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 11 giving it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and four giving it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. However, price targets for the AI darling represent a vast spread of opinions, with the high-end price target at $140, the median price target at $100.13 and the low-end price target at $40. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $40 -69.69% Median $1o0.13 -24.12% High $150 13.66% Palantir Technologies 2025 Outlook Palantir has made several important announcements over the past few weeks, including a $30 million contract with ICE to develop a system to help with deportations, and a partnership with TWG Global and xAI to bring AI to the financial services industry. That news has driven the stock higher in the short term. But as the broad market&#8217;s outlook remains clouded, so too does Palantir&#8217;s. That is reflected in Wall Street&#8217;s consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. The coming year for Palantir&#8217;s stock performance will continue to be shaped by the contracts it wins, both with the government and the private sector. Analysts project a 35% increase in revenue to $3.88 billion this year, though PLTR raised its guidance to $3.89 billion to $3.9 billion, up from its prior forecast of $3.74 billion to $3.75 billion. Palantir calls for a minimum 68% jump in commercial revenue to $1.178 billion, with CEO Alex Karp saying, &#8220;We are delivering the operating system for the modern enterprise in the era of AI.&#8221; While Palantir does face competition from both large AI Big Data forms, as well as smaller, fast-growing AI data analytics shops, the company can be seen as having an entrenched position within government and large enterprises. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Palantir Technologies is less bearish at $107, which represents 18.92% potential downside from the stock&#8217;s current price. Those figures are based on Palantir having developed the premier AI software, but the decreasing cost of AI and expansion of large language models to lower barriers to entrance in decision-making software. We see projected revenue growth rates moderating over time climb from $3.9 billion in 2025 to $11.9 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $0.58 in 2025 to $1.44 in 2030.

Constellation Energy (CEG) shares are surging in early trading Tuesday after the company said it had struck a 20-year deal to sell nuclear power to Meta Platforms (META), in the latest tech firm-to-nuclear collaboration aimed at powering data centers. Meta will buy the power generation of a Constellation nuclear plant in Clinton, Ill., to power its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions. The financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Starting in June 2027, ""the agreement supports the relicensing and continued operations of Constellation’s high-performing Clinton nuclear facility for another two decades after the state’s ratepayer funded zero emission credit (ZEC) program expires,"" Constellation said. ""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,"" Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, said of the deal.

This deal builds on earlier efforts by Constellation, which said last year it would be restarting Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide electricity for Microsoft’s data centers in a 20-year supply deal. More recently, executive orders signed by President Donald Trump last month to accelerate the approval of new reactors and strengthen fuel supply chains have also buoyed nuclear power stocks.

Five fascinating funds will tempt income seekers with potent yields and strong growth prospects. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Stock picking is fine, but exchange traded funds (ETFs) can enable immediate diversification without sacrificing growth and income opportunities. By selecting multiple funds instead of just one, you can achieve an extra measure of safety while also turning your portfolio into a veritable income-generating machine. The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/03/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-passive-income-machines/

Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-passive-income-machines/

AMZN,2025-05-28 14:06:21,Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/amazon-nasdaq-amzn-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-20250528.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost 2.29% over the past five trading sessions, halting a rally that has seen the stock gain 23.16% since its year-to-date low of $167.32 on April 21. On the year, the e-commerce giant has seen its stock lose 6.42% despite beating on EPS and revenue by 16.77% and 0.35%, respectively, in Q1. Tempered forward guidance due to President Trump&#8217;s tariffs continues to cloud Amazon&#8217;s outlook. However, with the U.S. and China agreeing to a 90-day reduction in tariffs on May 11, there is renewed hope for the consumer discretionary mainstay, who has seen its one-year gain diminished to 12.28%. In its recent earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% in 2025, with its one-year gain having been erased in Q1, which now stands at a 0.79% loss. In early April, Piper Sandler lowered its price target for Amazon to $215 from $265; however, the firm maintained its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating saying it is looking for Q1 revenue of $153B and within the $151B–$155B guidance range. Piper forecasts AWS growth of 17% year-over-year. For Q2, the firm anticipates a guidance range of $157B–$162B and op income guidance of $14B–$18B. Piper lowered its 2025 ads revenue growth by about 1% and online stores and 3P services. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. Key Points in This Article: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has sunk 15.15%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; $240.62 consensus price target is just shy of Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 48 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 64.01% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,927 position increases versus 2,426 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -5.02% Median $240.62 17.19% High $305.00 48.55% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumers appear to be pulling back on spending due to ongoing inflation, contracting GDP in Q1 and the possibility of a recession in 2025. Over the past month, however, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed admirably, posting a gain of 18.14%, second only to tech&#8217;s gain of 21.31% over the same period. That rebound represents a stark difference from the sector&#8217;s last-place performance among the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 11 sectors through Q1 2025. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

Both stocks have rallied by double-digit percentages in recent days. President Trump is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and tighten the window for new reactor license approvals to 18 months, a process that traditionally is infamous for being extremely lengthy. The markets are holding their gains, including a 2.1% advance in the Nasdaq Composite. Consumer Confidence Soars 10:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer Confidence surged in May, hitting 98 – a significant 12.3-point jump from April. This robust reading defied economists&#8217; predictions of 86, despite ongoing tariff concerns. The markets are widening their lead, including a nearly 2% jump in the Nasdaq Composite. Durable Goods Orders Reverse 9:55 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders fell 6.3% last month, a narrower decline than economists had anticipated but on the heels of four straight monthly increases. The latest data is a gauge on business spending in light of the tariffs. Boeing (NYSE: BA) orders were a drag, falling 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Optimism has seeped back into the markets, with all three of the major stock market averages coming out of the gate higher. President Trump announced a pause on proposed EU tariffs until July 9, fueling a 300-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Technology stocks are leading the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 each higher by over 1%. The proposed EU import tariff continues to hover at 50%, and July isn&#8217;t too far away, but for now, the markets are seeing the glass as half full. The Trump administration&#8217;s deal with the EU suggests further trade partner progress could be revealed sooner than later. Wall Street firm Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock ahead of the AI darling&#8217;s highly anticipated quarterly results due out tomorrow, advising investors to stay long on the stock and weather the uncertainty because the worst is behind them. Other Mag 7 stocks are higher today as well, including Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), each with a 1% jump. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is rallying 3.5% after Wedbush analysts labeled the EV maker an AI &#8220;pure play&#8221; and lifted the price target to $500 per share. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 378.17 (+0.89%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 275.40 (+1.5%) S&amp;P 500: Up 65.67 (+1.1%) Market Movers UBS has upgraded shares of LifeStance Health (Nasdaq: LFST) to a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on a bullish long-term outlook, sending the stock up 4%. Data analytics software stock Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is gaining 2% on the day in the tariff-fueled rally. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) will begin charging customers $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second later this week, a reversal of a longstanding &#8220;bags fly free&#8221; policy for the airline.

Both stocks have risen by double-digit percentages since President Trump issued an executive order last week. The president is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and shorten the wait for new reactor license approvals to one and a half years, a process that historically is known for moving at a snail&#8217;s pace. Business Orders Soften 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders posted a 6.3% decline last month, a softer drop than economists had predicted. However, this dip follows four consecutive months of increases, painting a mixed picture for business spending amid ongoing tariff discussions. A significant drag on the overall figures was Boeing (NYSE: BA), whose orders plunged 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Market sentiment has turned decidedly upbeat, with all three major stock market averages seeing gains from the open. President Trump agreed to delay proposed EU tariffs until July 9, which led to a 300-point jump for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also buoying stocks is the latest round of economic data. Consumer Confidence for May came in at a stronger than expected reading of 98, up 12.3 points month-over-month. Economists were calling for a reading of 86 in the face of tariffs.

AMZN,2025-05-28 12:10:40,Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/rivian-automotive-nasdaq-rivn-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-20250528.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) have retreated 9.1% over the past five trading sessions, reducing the stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 15.6%. After the recent first-quarter earnings report and downbeat guidance, some Wall Street analysts continue to downgrade the stock or decrease their price targets. Rivian, a prominent electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, is striving to regain momentum after its first-quarter earnings report on May 6. Despite surpassing Wall Street’s expectations with adjusted losses of $0.48 per share versus analyst expectations of $0.92 per share, and posting revenue of $1.24 billion compared to the $1.01 billion forecast, the stock fell almost 6% the next day, closing at $12.72 per share. This reflected a year-to-date loss of 4% and a 90% decline from its November 2021 IPO high. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The EV market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32% through 2030, but Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) forecasts lower deliveries for 2025 than in 2024. After reporting first-quarter earnings, the company has now seen consecutive quarters of positive gross profit, and its cash position remains strong. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Still, the stock has trended upward recently despite facing challenges from reduced delivery targets and tariff pressures. But it is countering those headwinds with cost efficiencies, strategic partnerships, and the anticipated R2 launch. 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis to give investors a better idea of where they can expect the stock to be in a year. Let&#8217;s take a look at whether Rivian can overcome its hurdles and return to growth. Why Invest in Rivian? Rivian is grappling with significant obstacles. First-quarter deliveries fell to 8,640 vehicles from 14,183 in the fourth quarter. A supply shortage in its Enduro motor system had an impact, and Los Angeles wildfires affected demand in a key market. The company lowered its 2025 delivery guidance to 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles from 46,000 to 51,000. It cited tariff uncertainties under the Trump administration, which could raise per-vehicle costs by thousands due to imported parts like steel, lithium-ion batteries, and rare earth minerals. The potential repeal of federal EV tax credits further threatens demand. Rivian is still losing a lot of money on every car it builds, even if it was able to reduce the per-share vehicle losses from $43,000 in Q4 to $38,798 in Q1. Moreover, it is likely car buyers front-loaded their purchases into the first quarter to beat any tariffs. Sales for the current quarter — and possibly the third quarter — could be weak. Still, a $5.8 billion joint venture with Volkswagen, with $1 billion expected by June 2025, bolsters Rivian’s $7.2 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments. The R2, a $45,000 midsize SUV set for 2026 production in Illinois, targets broader appeal, while plant upgrades — including a planned month-long shutdown in the second half of 2025 — aim to boost efficiency by 30%. Further, the EV market is expected to grow at a 32% CAGR through 2030, though Rivian projects full-year 2025 revenue of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, which at the midpoint is down from $4.97 billion last year. The hope is that the new R2 release and fleet sales could boost revenue further. For its part, Rivian has now seen consecutive quarters of positive gross profit. The EV maker just completed a 1.2 million sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, with plans for another facility in Georgia underway. That second facility could add an additional 400,000 units of annual capacity. As of the end of the first quarter, the company reported $7.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Rivian as a Company In its recent earnings call, Rivian reported $206 million of gross profit, making it the second consecutive quarter the company has seen positive gross profit figures. In order to address some challenges, the company also announced capex guidance of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion to help it address issues about its lagging deliverables. There are lingering concerns about how tariffs will impact Rivian, though. Material costs are expected to be elevated, equating to a few thousand dollars of impact per unit produced in 2025. Additionally, the company — despite seeing positive gross profit — has recorded adjusted EBITDA losses of $329 million, which it attributes to ongoing investment in R2 and key technologies. Despite the company manufacturing 100% of its vehicles in the U.S., tariff uncertainty presents a challenge to near-term growth prospects. But Rivian isn&#8217;t focusing strictly on individual consumers. In its first quarter, the company announced a partnership with HelloFresh, which has incorporated 70 Rivian Commercial Vans into its fleet. The endeavor marks the first major fleet customer for the EV maker since van sales opened more broadly earlier in 2025. Rivian as a Stock Since its 2021 IPO, Rivian’s stock has been volatile, soaring to $180 before crashing 90%. After hitting a low of $10.36 in April, it rebounded this month, supported by first-quarter gross profit and Volkswagen funding. The announcement by President Trump of a major new trade deal with the U.K. in early May caused the stock to jump, while the tariff pause agreement between the United States and China on May 11 resulted in another bump for the EV stock. Analyst sentiment remains cautious, with a consensus Hold rating from 28 analysts. Their average price target of $14.73 per share implies more than 4% downside. Targets range between $7.05 and $23.00 per share. Piper Sandler recently downgraded Rivian stock to Neutral, citing tariff risks. Wedbush lowered its target to $18 per share, though it is still optimistic about R2. Rivian’s cash reserves show it has money to keep from going out of business anytime soon. However, substantial, ongoing losses reflect the long-term profitability challenges it faces. Other analysts are more bullish, with Stifel&#8217;s Stephen Gengaro raising his price target to $18 from $16 and maintaining a Buy rating. According to Nasdaq.com, institutional investors hold 55.73% of the company&#8217;s outstanding shares. And 345 of them have recently increased their holdings, while 296 have decreased their holdings. Incidentally, the largest holder of Rivian stock is not Vanguard, BlackRock, or another financial services firm. It is Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which holds more than 158 million shares. Estimate Price Target Change From Current Price Low $7.05 −54.0% Median $14.73 −4.2% High $23.00 49.6% Rivian’s cost efficiencies, gross profit milestone, and R2 launch position it for growth. Yet, tariff uncertainties beyond the U.K. deal and demand softness require investor caution. With 32% projected EV market growth and strategic partnerships, Rivian could achieve modest delivery gains in 2025. Its cash buffer and Volkswagen deal offer some stability, but execution risks remain. Rivian should only be considered a speculative buy for risk-tolerant investors betting on its long-term EV market role. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Rivian Automotive is bearish at $13.20 per share. That represents 14.1% downside potential from the stock’s current price. Those figures are based on Rivian facing existing weakness in the EV market due to sales having been pulled forward into the first quarter and the new R2 not due out till next year. We see projected growth rates allowing revenue to rise from $4.8 billion in 2025 to $9.6 billion in 2030, alongside net losses improving from $4.69 per share in 2025 to break even by 2030.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) gained 1.38% over the past five trading sessions, brining its one-month gain to an eye-catching 36.04% as the stock continues to rally back from disastrous losses in Q1. The recent gains have been welcomed by investors who have endured a year-do-date loss of 9.97% and seen the stock slip 28.82% since hitting its all-time high of $479.86 on Dec. 17, 2024. Buy-and-hold investors are hopeful the EV maker has found its bottom amid a highly volatile six-month stretch. But the recent rally in TSLA comes despite a poor earnings report in Q1 followed by collapsing sales figures in the U.S. and abroad. In early May, it was reported that Tesla has around $800 million worth of Cybertrucks stuck on lots. It was also reported this month that, in addition to collapsing sales in Europe broadly, Tesla has seen sales in Sweden plunges 80.7%. In April, it was reported that Tesla now accounts for fewer than 50% of EV sales in California. After absorbing enormous losses, Elon Musk&#8217;s EV empire fell outside of the $1 trillion club, but as of May 19, the company&#8217;s market cap stands at $1.09 trillion. Nonetheless, questions linger as to whether the company&#8217;s most ambitious of growth drivers (think Cybercab and Optimus humanoid robot, both of which were featured at the company&#8217;s robotaxi event last year) will bear fruit sooner rather than later. Indeed, Tesla&#8217;s stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk&#8217;s role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk&#8217;s friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla&#8217;s outlook remains clouded. In any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let&#8217;s check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it&#8217;s a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term. Key Points in This Article: Tesla remains the leader of the EV revolution, dominating global market share despite the stock&#8217;s recent struggles. The company faces numerous headwinds, which could ultimately impact its long-term performance.

Tesla&#8217;s Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along For a stock that&#8217;s fallen significantly, I&#8217;d expect the growth narrative to have been severely impacted. Tesla&#8217;s latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla&#8217;s most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully. Undoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it&#8217;s one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas&#8217; view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied &#8220;AI ETF&#8221; given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes. Though Tesla&#8217;s AI efforts are exciting, it&#8217;s important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it&#8217;s to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla&#8217;s been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories? The most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there&#8217;s also the rumored &#8220;Model Q&#8221; entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a &#8220;wild card.&#8221; Bull Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price Cybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla&#8217;s robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk&#8217;s vision of the robotaxi future could be a reality within Trump&#8217;s term. Of course, a more realistic timeframe would put such a future more than 10 years out. However, if Tesla can floor it on full self-driving (FSD) efforts, perhaps such a future could be closer to the present. There&#8217;s a great deal of uncertainty with FSD, given the technical and regulatory unknowns. Either way, I view Musk&#8217;s friendship with Trump as a boon for a Cybertruck rollout under his administration. If Cybertruck expands its presence and becomes a hit within years rather than decades, TSLA stock could prove a bargain, given all that there is to gain. The big question, though, is how Cybercab will hold its own as Waymo pushes ahead with its impressive offering. Given robotaxis, like generative AI, are unlikely to be a &#8220;winner takes all&#8221; market, I think there&#8217;s no reason why both robotaxi offerings can&#8217;t win big from prime-time adoption of self-driving. Another big question to consider is whether consumers will be interested in buying up Cybercabs to have them rolling around on the streets as ride-hailers. I think the business could prove quite lucrative for buyers and Tesla&#8217;s margins over the long haul. After all, it can sell the car and continue to build a ride-hailing network while profiting from use of a ride-hailing app of sorts. Cathie Wood thinks autonomous ride-hailing could represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. If Tesla can get a nice slice, Wood sees TSLA stock at $2,600 per share by 2029. Personally, I think the bull case (for the year ahead) could see TSLA at around $550 per share — or 100.19% higher than where the stock is trading today. That target is shared by Wedbush Securities&#8217; Dan Ives, one of my favorite analysts in tech. Optimus: Optimus was a nice addition to the robotaxis event as it amused attendees. But the big question is how much potential the robot has once it&#8217;s ready to go on sale to the general public. Undoubtedly, Tesla isn&#8217;t the only one getting into the robotics game. Many Mag Seven members also investing heavily in home robots. While more rivals in home robots could be a threat to Optimus, I view it as more of a confirmation that there is a place in the home for such profound innovations. As for the home robotics market, I do see 2026 as a tad overly optimistic for a launch. However, if robot &#8220;friends&#8221; do arrive by 2030, I think Tesla&#8217;s growth rate could reaccelerate back to or even above 25% to 30% for some amount of time. Bear Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price Cybertruck: Undoubtedly, there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do before Cybertruck makes an impact on the car market. FSD capabilities need to step things up and the vehicle needs to be made in a way that won&#8217;t break the bank. These are big asks. Some bears have doubts about whether the firm can execute the opportunity. In late March, the company announced that it was recalling nearly every Cybertruck due to a potential crash risk. This was an enormous blow to Musk&#8217;s ambitions for the EV, which has already been subjected to harsh criticism about its perceived shortcomings among owners. Ross Gerber, who previously owned shares, has sold out with the view a 50% crash would be in store for 2025. He also thinks FSD &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221; If true, that&#8217;s a gut punch to Tesla&#8217;s biggest growth driver. Either way, there&#8217;s not too much room lower with TSLA now off 40%. With Guggenheim labeling TSLA stock as a Sell with a $175 target, I&#8217;d brace for even more pain if the market sell-off intensifies. That price target represents additional downside potential of 36.30% from today&#8217;s share price. Bad Press: Musk&#8217;s deteriorated image at the hands of his federal government involvement with DOGE aside, Tesla has continued to bear the brunt of bad news. In late 2024, it was widely reported that the EV maker was the most dangerous vehicle brand, with the number of deaths among all automakers, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. According to the study, Tesla has a fatal accident rate of 5.6 per billion vehicle miles, compared to the overall average of just 2.8. Additionally, ongoing protests against the brand — including vandalism and arson — have occurred around the globe, from Italy and France to numerous states in the U.S. Optimus: Even if home robots are on the horizon, good luck asking consumers to spend thousands on a proven technology. Indeed, if Vision Pro taught us anything, it&#8217;s that being an early adopter is expensive and probably not the best use of funds. Either way, I&#8217;d much rather wait and see how the robot ambitions pan out before getting too excited at this stage. Insider &amp; Institutional Activity: There&#8217;s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests investors should &#8220;follow the money.&#8221; If that&#8217;s the current case for Tesla, money is flowing out. In fact, over the past 12 years, no one single share of TSLA has been purchased by insiders (e.g., the company&#8217;s executives, directors or anyone who owns 10% or more of the company), according to Nasdaq.com. Data from Finviz supports this, even showing that Musk himself, as well as his brother, have been offloading shares since late 2024. Additionally, institutional ownership has now decreased to just 48.76%. In total, 479 institutional investors have entirely liquidated their Tesla positions, with 1,892 institutional holders having decreased their positions versus 2,015 who have increased them. Price Targets: In April, Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on Tesla to $260 from $275 while maintaining a neutral rating. The firm reduced its auto industry outlook and estimates, saying it will be difficult for the auto industry to fully pass on tariff costs, especially given softening consumer demand. Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs&#8217; one-year price target represents downside potential of 23.73% from today&#8217;s price. Increased competition: Also in April, a Jeff Bezos-backed EV company called Slate unveiled affordable EV truck and SUV models that cost $20,000 after federal incentives. The company has billed itself as the &#8220;anti-Tesla,&#8221; and is made in the U.S. As Tesla&#8217;s market share has fallen under 50% in EV-friendly California, the arrival of Slate could continue to erode sales. Base Case for Tesla&#8217;s Share Price The base case for Tesla lies somewhere in between the two extremes. Wall Street analysts have assigned TSLA a median one-year price target of $260 share, or 23.73% potential downside from today&#8217;s price. Meanwhile, the high-end target is $500 and the low-end target is $19.05. I&#8217;m inclined to view the $300 level as a fair-value level for the stock. Much of Tesla&#8217;s story depends on its big growth drivers. In the meantime, EV sales and the rise of more affordable models (Model Q) could be nearer-term stories to look forward to as one waits for the biggest of drivers to pay off. At the time of writing, TSLA stock goes for 176.56 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 9.58 times froward price-to-sales (P/S). That makes the name slightly undervalued, at least in my view.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) have gained 13.8% over the past five trading sessions, bringing the stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 26.9%. Yet, after the recent first-quarter earnings report and downbeat guidance, some Wall Street analysts continue to downgrade the stock or decrease their price targets. Rivian, a prominent electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, is striving to regain momentum after its first-quarter earnings report on May 6. Despite surpassing Wall Street’s expectations with adjusted losses of $0.48 per share versus analyst expectations of $0.92 per share, and posting revenue of $1.24 billion compared to the $1.01 billion forecast, the stock fell almost 6% the next day, closing at $12.72 per share. This reflected a year-to-date loss of 4% and a 90% decline from its November 2021 IPO high. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The EV market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32% through 2030, but Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) forecasts lower deliveries for 2025 than in 2024. After reporting first-quarter earnings, the company has now seen consecutive quarters of positive gross profit, and its cash position remains strong. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Still, the stock has trended upward recently despite facing challenges from reduced delivery targets and tariff pressures. But it is countering those headwinds with cost efficiencies, strategic partnerships, and the anticipated R2 launch. 24/7 Wall St. conducted some analysis to give investors a better idea of where they can expect the stock to be in a year. Let&#8217;s take a look at whether Rivian can overcome its hurdles and return to growth. Why Invest in Rivian? Rivian is grappling with significant obstacles. First-quarter deliveries fell to 8,640 vehicles from 14,183 in the fourth quarter. A supply shortage in its Enduro motor system had an impact, and Los Angeles wildfires affected demand in a key market. The company lowered its 2025 delivery guidance to 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles from 46,000 to 51,000. It cited tariff uncertainties under the Trump administration, which could raise per-vehicle costs by thousands due to imported parts like steel, lithium-ion batteries, and rare earth minerals. The potential repeal of federal EV tax credits further threatens demand. Rivian is still losing a lot of money on every car it builds, even if it was able to reduce the per-share vehicle losses from $43,000 in Q4 to $38,798 in Q1. Moreover, it is likely car buyers front-loaded their purchases into the first quarter to beat any tariffs. Sales for the current quarter — and possibly the third quarter — could be weak. Still, a $5.8 billion joint venture with Volkswagen, with $1 billion expected by June 2025, bolsters Rivian’s $7.2 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments. The R2, a $45,000 midsize SUV set for 2026 production in Illinois, targets broader appeal, while plant upgrades — including a planned month-long shutdown in the second half of 2025 — aim to boost efficiency by 30%. Further, the EV market is expected to grow at a 32% CAGR through 2030, though Rivian projects full-year 2025 revenue of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, which at the midpoint is down from $4.97 billion last year. The hope is that the new R2 release and fleet sales could boost revenue further. For its part, Rivian has now seen consecutive quarters of positive gross profit. The EV maker just completed a 1.2 million sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, with plans for another facility in Georgia underway. That second facility could add an additional 400,000 units of annual capacity. As of the end of the first quarter, the company reported $7.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Rivian as a Company In its recent earnings call, Rivian reported $206 million of gross profit, making it the second consecutive quarter the company has seen positive gross profit figures. In order to address some challenges, the company also announced capex guidance of $1.8 billion to $1.9 million to help it address issues about its lagging deliverables. There are lingering concerns about how tariffs will impact Rivian, though. Material costs are expected to be elevated, equating to a few thousand dollars of impact per unit produced in 2025. Additionally, the company — despite seeing positive gross profit — has recorded adjusted EBITDA losses of $329 million, which it attributes to ongoing investment in R2 and key technologies. Despite the company manufacturing 100% of its vehicles in the U.S., tariff uncertainty presents a challenge to near-term growth prospects. But Rivian isn&#8217;t focusing strictly on individual consumers. In its first quarter, the company announced a partnership with HelloFresh, which has incorporated 70 Rivian Commercial Vans into its fleet. The endeavor marks the first major fleet customer for the EV maker since van sales opened more broadly earlier in 2025. Rivian as a Stock Since its 2021 IPO, Rivian’s stock has been volatile, soaring to $180 before crashing 90%. After hitting a low of $10.36 in April, it rebounded this month, supported by first-quarter gross profit and Volkswagen funding. The announcement by President Trump of a major new trade deal with the U.K. in early May caused the stock to jump, while the tariff pause agreement between the United States and China on May 11 resulted in another bump for the EV stock. Analyst sentiment remains cautious, with a consensus Hold rating from 28 analysts. Their average price target of $14.65 per share implies more than 13% downside. Targets range between $7.05 and $23.00 per share. Piper Sandler downgraded Rivian stock to Neutral, citing tariff risks. Wedbush lowered its target to $18 per share, though it is still optimistic about R2. Rivian’s cash reserves show it has money to keep from going out of business anytime soon. However, substantial, ongoing losses reflect the long-term profitability challenges it faces. Other analysts are more bullish, with Stifel&#8217;s Stephen Gengaro raising his price target to $18 from $16 and maintaining a Buy rating. According to Nasdaq.com, institutional investors hold 55.73% of the company&#8217;s outstanding shares. And 345 of them have recently increased their holdings, while 296 have decreased their holdings. Incidentally, the largest holder of Rivian stock is not Vanguard, BlackRock, or another financial services firm. It is Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which holds more than 158 million shares. Estimate Price Target Change From Current Price Low $7.05 −58.5% Median $14.65 −13.7% High $23.00 35.5% Rivian’s cost efficiencies, gross profit milestone, and R2 launch position it for growth. Yet, tariff uncertainties beyond the U.K. deal and demand softness require investor caution. With 32% projected EV market growth and strategic partnerships, Rivian could achieve modest delivery gains in 2025. Its cash buffer and Volkswagen deal offer some stability, but execution risks remain. Rivian should only be considered a speculative buy for risk-tolerant investors betting on its long-term EV market role. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Rivian Automotive is bearish at $13.20 per share. That represents 22.2% downside potential from the stock’s current price. Those figures are based on Rivian facing existing weakness in the EV market due to sales having been pulled forward into the first quarter and the new R2 not due out till next year. We see projected growth rates allowing revenue to rise from $4.8 billion in 2025 to $9.6 billion in 2030, alongside net losses improving from $4.69 per share in 2025 to break even by 2030.

AMZN,2025-05-22 11:09:08,Snowflake (SNOW) 1st Quarter Earnings Live Coverage,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/snowflake-snow-1st-quarter-earnings-live-coverage-20250522.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Quick Recap 4:20 pm EPS (Non-GAAP): Not disclosed in the release — awaiting transcript or call.(The pre-release guidance implied ~$0.22–$0.23. Likely in line or modest beat) Product Revenue: $996.8M actual vs. $1.01B estimate → ~1.3% miss Total Revenue: $1.04B actual vs. $1.02–$1.03B consensus range → Slight beat Note: SNOW’s after-hours +5.6% move suggests Street was bracing for a softer print; RPO strength offset revenue miss. Up 5.6% After Hours — Execution Beat Clears the Bar, For Now 4:16 pm Snowflake shares rose 5.6% after hours following its Q1 print, signaling that the market was bracing for worse and found the steady revenue growth and robust RPO more than enough to offset deepening losses. While profitability remains a drag, the strong customer expansion and $6.7B in RPO validated the demand story — especially with enterprise software sentiment still fragile across the board. This price action suggests investors were more concerned about a usage slowdown or a reset in long-term guidance — neither of which materialized. The 606 million-dollar customers and continued momentum in AI narrative positioning helped reinforce Snowflake’s status as a durable platform name with optionality, even if monetization of next-gen features like Cortex and Snowpark is still emerging. That said, this reaction also likely reflects relief more than re-rating. For Snowflake to reclaim its high-multiple valuation and push beyond the $190–$200 zone, investors will eventually need more than just growth. Margin progress or explicit AI revenue metrics would be the likely fuel for a true breakout — but tonight, it’s clear the bar was set low enough for a beat to rally the stock. Snowflake Delivers $997M in Product Revenue but Posts Wider Loss 4:13 pm Snowflake’s fiscal Q1 2026 results came in largely aligned with investor expectations on the top line, but profitability remains a sticking point. Product revenue rose 26% year-over-year to $996.8 million, meeting guidance and extending the company’s streak of solid double-digit growth. Total revenue hit $1.04 billion, a new quarterly record. Remaining performance obligations grew 34% to $6.7 billion, suggesting healthy forward demand. Despite the top-line strength, Snowflake posted a GAAP net loss of $430 million, or $1.29 per share, a significantly wider loss than the same quarter last year. Operating expenses climbed over 25%, with sales and marketing costs topping $458 million and R&amp;D reaching $472 million. Adjusted free cash flow also shrank year-over-year to $206.3 million, reflecting heavier investment in operations and headcount amid platform expansion. The AI Data Cloud strategy was again front and center. Snowflake now serves 606 customers generating more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue, up 27% YoY. But profitability remains elusive as the company continues to prioritize infrastructure scale and product build-out over margin. Past earnings reactions 3:43 pm Snowflake has topped EPS estimates in three of the last four quarters, but price reactions have been muted — with the exception of the Q1 FY25 miss, which triggered a sharp selloff. The pattern is clear: beats don’t drive the stock unless accompanied by upside in usage metrics like RPO or product revenue. For tonight, merely hitting numbers may not be enough. Investors will be listening closely for evidence of traction in AI-native features and signs that larger enterprise customers are expanding usage across Snowflake’s platform. Quarter EPS Actual EPS Est. Surprise Stock Reaction Q4 FY25 $0.30 $0.17 +76% +4% Q3 FY25 $0.20 $0.15 +33% Flat Q2 FY25 $0.18 $0.16 +13% Flat/–1% Q1 FY25 $0.14 $0.18 –21% –12% Snowflake stock sentiment 3:32 pm Investor sentiment on Snowflake remains split. Institutional ownership remains high, but options activity ahead of earnings has leaned bullish, with elevated call volume near the $190 and $200 strikes. Despite the stock’s strong year-to-date performance, short interest is modest — under 3% of float — suggesting limited outright bearish conviction. However, many large funds have taken a wait-and-see stance following Snowflake’s stock-based comp controversy and uneven quarterly billings trends. Sell-side analysts are cautiously optimistic, with most ratings clustered in the Buy-to-Hold range and a median target around $203 — only modestly above current levels. Earnings-day volatility is typically elevated for SNOW, with options pricing implying a post-print move of ~7–9%. A strong RPO or AI monetization update could push shares through recent resistance, while muted platform usage data could invite a reset. AI Story Is Clear, Monetization Path Still Isn’t 2:37 pm On the last call, Snowflake executives leaned hard into the AI Data Cloud narrative. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy highlighted Cortex, Snowpark Container Services, and partnerships with Nvidia as cornerstones of Snowflake’s long-term roadmap. The company repeatedly emphasized that generative AI workloads would become a major source of data growth — and that Snowflake is positioned to be the “governed data layer” for those deployments. But investors came away with more vision than numbers. There was no quantification of AI’s contribution to RPO or ARR, and management offered little detail on attach rates for Snowpark or Cortex. Another focus was operational discipline. CFO Mike Scarpelli emphasized cost control and headcount restraint as drivers of recent EPS strength, while acknowledging that stock-based compensation remains elevated. With share-based comp still at over 40% of revenue, Snowflake’s narrative needs to transition from visionary to operationally credible. What to watch this quarter: Updated commentary on AI feature usage and client interest Any revenue disclosure tied to Cortex or Snowpark Signals on NRR or multi-product adoption Tone shift from visionary to accountable execution Keys to watch 1:28 pm In recent quarters, Snowflake has delivered impressive headline beats but raised concerns under the surface — particularly around deal timing and monetization of new AI products. While Q4 FY25 posted a strong $0.30 EPS vs. $0.17 estimate, much of the beat was driven by expense control rather than accelerating usage. The company has emphasized its AI Data Cloud vision and the rollout of Snowflake Cortex — a generative AI suite embedded in the platform — but has not disclosed revenue contribution from these new services. Analysts will be pressing for any update on attach rates or NRR improvements tied to AI features. Another key trend is stock-based compensation. SBC accounted for 41% of revenue last year, drawing scrutiny from institutional investors. Any moderation here — especially as revenue scales — could boost confidence in the path to GAAP profitability. Watch for: RPO growth (billings proxy) AI-related platform adoption commentary SBC as % of revenue New customer count and expansion rates Data Cloud Macro Tailwinds Must Now Show Up in Usage and Margins 12:27 pm Snowflake operates in a sweet spot of enterprise software — a data infrastructure layer increasingly central to AI deployment. But that macro opportunity has yet to fully translate into breakout earnings power. With usage-based revenue still sensitive to customer optimization cycles, investors are looking for signals that the stabilization seen across AWS and Azure is flowing into Snowflake’s billings and RPO. Last quarter’s beat was strong on paper — $0.30 EPS vs. $0.17 expected — but was driven more by cost control than visible AI monetization. This quarter, investors will be looking closely at product revenue growth, RPO trajectory, and any signs that Snowflake’s newer features like Cortex AI and Snowpark Containers are seeing measurable traction. The AI Data Cloud story is compelling, but to move the stock higher, Snowflake must prove it is winning real workloads and expanding usage — not just demoing new features. Gross margin and customer count detail will be key earnings call focal points. Snowflake (NASDAQ: SNOW) heads into its earnings report after the market closes today with investors watching closely for signs of margin discipline and execution in enterprise AI workloads. Shares are up more than 20% year to date, fueled by bullish sentiment around Snowflake’s positioning in the data infrastructure layer of the modern tech stack. But after a sharp miss one year ago and only modest improvements to operating leverage, the company still needs to prove it can convert product excitement into scalable, profitable growth. The Street expects first-quarter revenue of $1.01 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.21 — representing year-over-year growth of 21% and 51%, respectively. Those headline numbers are strong, but they come with an asterisk: Snowflake’s usage-based pricing model has led to uneven quarter-to-quarter trends, and many analysts are now more focused on remaining performance obligations (RPO) and net revenue retention (NRR) than simple top-line beats. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, who took over earlier this year, has emphasized streamlining the product suite and embedding generative AI tools into core workflows. The company’s “AI Data Cloud” narrative has gained traction with analysts, but actual monetization from new products like Cortex and Snowpark remains difficult to quantify. Investors are also watching for improvements in profitability. Last fiscal year, stock-based compensation accounted for over 40% of revenue — a figure that’s drawn increasing scrutiny from both institutional holders and sell-side coverage. With FY26 full-year EPS forecast at just $1.16 and GAAP profitability still elusive, this quarter needs to show more than just robust customer activity. Snowflake has a narrative tailwind — but to keep the stock’s valuation intact, it has to start delivering earnings momentum to match.

It stands at $381 billion, and it is rising sharply. According to Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, co-founder of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), is a distant second at $227 billion. Key Points Elon Musk&#8217;s Net Worth Is Almost $400 billion. Tesla&#8217;s Stock Price Recovery Is A Factor Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The primary catalyst for the increase is Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock recovery. He co-founded the EV company and is CEO. Tesla’s market cap is $1.13 trillion, which ranks it eighth among all public companies. Musk owns 13% of the shares outstanding. Tesla’s stock has risen 44% in the last month, while the S&amp;P is up 18%. That contrasts with the price year to date, which is down 13%, while the market is flat over the same period. Tesla continues to have challenges. After years of rising, the company delivered 1.789 million vehicles in 2024, down 1.07% from 2023. The problem has worsened this year. In the first quarter, deliveries fell 13% to 336,681. In some EU nations, the percentage drop was higher. Tesla is also losing ground in China, the world’s largest EV market. Local Chinese companies, particularly BYD, have hampered its sales. Musk’s relationship with President Trump has also eroded sales. Other Musk holdings have helped his overall wealth. The largest of these is the most successful rocket maker in the world. SpaceX virtually controls the U.S. rocket business and is the leader in the industry worldwide. It has established itself as the preeminent rocket launch provider, lofting satellites, cargo, and people to space for NASA, the Pentagon, and commercial partners. It is building out a large network of Starlink satellites providing internet service. Some observers believe Musk’s relationship with President Trump could help him get additional business from the U.S. government. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX and has 79% of the company’s voting shares. He can make decisions about SpaceX without challenge. SpaceX was recently valued at $350 billion. Among Musk’s other holdings, the most valuable may eventually be xAI, a major rival to OpenAI in the race to control the future of AI. xAI recently raised $6 billion, which puts its value at between $40 billion and $50 billion. Musk owns over half of xAI. The valuation of OpenAI recently hit $157 billion. Musk recently merged xAI with social media company X. The value of these combined is $100 billion Musk owns parts of several other companies, including social media platform X and implantable brain-computer interface operation Neuralink.

AMZN,2025-05-13 08:00:04,The Stock Market Crash That Could Ruin Everything,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-stock-market-crash-that-could-ruin-everything-20250513.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"The stock market had a 20% reset in April, which lasted only a few days, if even that. Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

The firm wrote: “The large reduction in the U.S. tariff rate on China should only have a limited impact on the overall U.S. effective tariff rate.

When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.

Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also getting a pop from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a strong Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 114.55 (+0.26%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 102.00 (+0.57%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.36 (+0.41%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but that is what it takes to trade as one of the leading tech stocks. As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is taking a breather after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire options trading platform Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal, thrusting it into the crypto derivatives realm.

Earlier today, President Trump proved that he was willing to lower tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are expected to come to the negotiating table over the weekend. Stocks are under pressure on the trade deal uncertainty. Aimless Markets 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo Today&#8217;s gains have faded as traders hold out for closure on a trade agreement between the U.S. and China. The three major indices are now trading mixed, including a 0.06% gain in the S&amp;P 500, 0.13% gain in the Nasdaq Composite and 0.13% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Markets are likely to continue trading aimlessly until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. S&amp;P 500 This Week 10:15 am by Gerelyn Terzo Despite today&#8217;s gains, the S&amp;P 500 remains modestly lower for the week, with a 0.06% decline as of Friday morning. There&#8217;s still time for the index to push even higher, especially if the White House announces further tariff agreements with international trade partners. CNBC reported that the broader market index remains mired below a key resistance level, making it difficult for it to break out higher. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Tariffs are having a live by the sword, die by the sword effect, and today that is translating to gains. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from over 100% to 80%, saying that level seems reasonable as Washington, D.C. gears up for negotiations with Beijing. Stocks are rightfully cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning but keeping it modest. The SPX ETF is gaining 0.25% as of morning trading. China could be the first of many tariff deals in the works with U.S. trade partners, according to the White House, further lifting market sentiment. Most sectors of the economy are moving higher, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are participating in the gains, with Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) rising 1% while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is adding 6.8%. TSLA stock is on its way to reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being lifted in part by Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a desirable Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 82.49 (+0.20%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 114.14 (+0.63%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22.51 (+0.40%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but it&#8217;s also one of the leading tech stocks. As of Thursday, Palantir was added to the top-10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, with a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. Comparatively, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers below that level at $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is taking it on the chin today, down fractionally. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is skyrocketing by over 20% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue soared by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is climbing 20.3% higher today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Expedia Group (Nasdaq: EXPE) is down 7.3% on the day on a Wall Street downgrade to &#8220;underweight&#8221; by Piper Sandler analysts.

Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) provides strong cryptographic security and audit capabilities, minimizing fraud and illegal access. Entities within the BFSI, legal, and healthcare sectors are implementing BaaS to enhance verification procedures, mitigate operational risks, and bolster trust among stakeholders. Increasing Adoption in Supply Chain and Logistics: Blockchain facilitates real-time asset monitoring, provenance verification, and immutable recording—essential requirements for contemporary supply chains. Logistics firms, manufacturers, and retailers are integrating BaaS platforms to assure compliance, mitigate counterfeit concerns, and improve supplier transparency. Due to increasing ESG and traceability demands, companies are investing in BaaS to digitally transform their comprehensive supply networks. Growth of Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps): Smart contracts are transforming enterprise automation by eliminating the necessity for third-party validation in contractual processes. Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) solutions empower enterprises to construct, implement, and oversee smart contracts on scalable blockchain networks without necessitating internal blockchain infrastructure. Industries such as insurance, finance, and energy are adopting BaaS to mitigate delays, enforce contractual commitments, and diminish disputes through self-executing protocols. To Purchase a Comprehensive Report Analysis: https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/select-licence?rid=10565 Market Restraint Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance Challenges: The international blockchain regulatory framework is disjointed and continues to develop. Businesses encounter uncertainty around the alignment of blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and digital identities with local compliance regulations, including GDPR, HIPAA, and financial reporting standards. The intricate regulatory landscape, especially for cross-border operations, obstructs comprehensive BaaS implementations and introduces legal and reputational risks. High Implementation and Integration Costs: While BaaS diminishes the price associated with constructing blockchain infrastructure from the ground up, overall implementation costs might be considerable. Organizations must allocate resources for customisation, user training, legacy system integration, and post-deployment maintenance. For SMEs, the initial and recurring expenses remain high, deterring adoption despite the technology's promise for long-term ROI. Limited Availability of Blockchain Expertise: Blockchain continues to be a specialized competency inside the global labor market. Many firms lack the internal technical expertise necessary to efficiently implement, scale, and secure BaaS infrastructures. The learning curve related to distributed ledger technologies, consensus processes, and smart contract programming hinders implementation deadlines. This skills deficit increases dependence on external consultants and impedes innovation cycles. Geographical Dominance North America possesses the predominant stake in the Blockchain As A Service (BaaS) industry, propelled by early adoption in financial services, healthcare, and logistics. The existence of influential major actors, along with robust regulatory support for digital transformation, drives regional growth.

After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

AMZN,2025-04-30 12:05:47,Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Stand Still on Tariff and Tech Tussle,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/live-nasdaq-composite-markets-stand-still-on-tariff-and-20250430.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Trade Deals 3:06 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly revealed that the U.S. has secured one trade deal, keeping most of the details close to the vest except to say that the White House is awaiting a green light from some unnamed country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 300 points in response for a 0.84% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are holding similar gains. Narrow Range 12:34 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are managing slight gains across the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average despite the absence of greater details on any global trade deals. Of the S&amp;P 500, Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield is cited by CNBC as saying, “I think [stocks are] probably trapped in a in a pretty tight range here,&#8221; pointing to a range of 5,100-5,700. “I think we can bounce around there for quite a while in kind of some volatile, choppy trading. Until we get some resolution on the trade front, I don’t think much else matters,&#8221; he added. Consumer Weakness 11:03 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market averages are currently all moving higher despite some weaker than anticipated economic data. The U.S. consumer has long been credited with upholding the economy throughout the one-two punch of inflation and higher interest rates. Now the tariffs could be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, as consumer confidence shows signs of waning. The Consumer Confidence Index published by the Conference Board sank to a reading of 86 in April, a drop of nearly 8 points from the prior month and below economist estimates calling for 87.7. A separate index that reflects consumer sentiment over the next six months fell by a steep 12.5 points to a reading of 54.4, its worst level in over a decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that March job postings dropped to their lowest level in about six months. Tariffs, Earnings and Tech 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets continue to trade mixed this morning on tariff deal ambiguity as Q1 earnings results pour in. Stocks are weighing earnings results and a lack of certainty on the tariff deal front while tensions have emerged between Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and the White House over tariff-related costs. Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed, with Amazon and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) trading in the red while Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) benefits from a Wall Street endorsement. Hims &amp; Hers HEalth (Nasdaq: HIMS) is soaring by 24% today on news of a deal to sell weight loss drug phenom Wegovy on its e-commerce platform. The markets are holding out for more tariff deal progress, digging in their heels and nearly standing still in the meantime. The three major stock market averages are moving fractionally in either direction, with the Nasdaq Composite posting slight declines alongside the S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Sectors of the economy are evenly split between red and green, with real estate moving higher and consumer discretionary stocks headed lower. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is getting some unwanted attention after the White House took aim at the tech giant, calling its reported plans to list tariff cost impacts on its site as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Big 3 automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported better-than-expected quarterly results while reassessing its full-year outlook, sending the stock lower by 1.5%. GM and the auto sector have targets on their backs at the height of the tariff wars, in response to which the former Dow component has suspended all share buyback programs. The White House has affirmed its plans to provide tariff relief to the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 138.11 (+0.36%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 67.15 (-0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Down 10.23 (-0.19%) Earnings &amp; Analyst Calls Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) surpassed Q1 expectations on the top and bottom lines and is keeping its full-year guidance intact amid expectations that it will be able to manage any tariff-related fallout, including rising aluminum costs. Rival company PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) recently lowered its earnings forecast due to the tariff impact. Evercore ISI has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock with a $250 price target, suggesting the company&#8217;s strategies should help it to offset any impact from the tariff frenzy. Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), saying that the China tariff uncertainties notwithstanding, the AI leader&#8217;s strong market relationships give the stock a place in the analyst firm&#8217;s top large cap pick universe. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) but lowered the price target to $253 from $272, owing to what it described as &#8220;potential demand destruction.&#8221; The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Stand Still on Tariff and Tech Tussle appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/04/29/live-nasdaq-composite-markets-stand-still-on-tariff-and-tech-tussle/

This included longtime fiancee Lauren Sanchez. In the meantime, the stock of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which he co-founded, has risen 8% in the past month while the market has been flat. Bezos’s net worth has recently risen above $200 billion to $203 billion. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Jeff Bezos’s net worth has recently risen above $200 billion. His primary source of wealth is AI and e-commerce colossus Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Amazon’s market cap is $2 trillion. That makes it the fourth most valuable company in the world, behind Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Bezos is the second richest man in the world, which puts him behind Elon Musk at $335. Musk’s net worth has plunged $97 billion this year. Bezos’s is down $29 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It&#8217;s All About Amazon Bezos’s primary source of wealth is Amazon, of which he owns 9%. He founded it in 1994 with his then-wife MacKenzie Scott. He was CEO from 1994 to 2021. He turned the company from an online bookstore to the largest e-commerce site in the world. In 2022, he started Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is now the world’s biggest cloud computing company. In the most recent quarter, it had operating income of $10.6 billion, compared to a total of $20 billion for the entire company. As is the case with most megatech companies, the future success of Amazon is in artificial intelligence (AI). It recently invested $8 billion into Anthropic, which is one of the world’s largest AI startups. Amazon also said it would invest $100 billion in capital expenditures, most of which will go to AI R&amp;D and server farms. CEO Andy Jassy commented, “I think that both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy, medium to long-term, that we’re pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.” Amazon is in a foot race for AI dominance. Other companies in the race include OpenAI, Musk’s xAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. How well Amazon does will affect Bezos’s future net worth as much as anything.

Trade Talks Keep S&amp;P 500 Moving Higher 1:51 pm &#8220;Ask, and ye shall receive.&#8221; Investors for example have been asking a lot lately, for proof that President Trump&#8217;s tariffs threats will result in trade deals that can benefit the U.S. economy. Today, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the conclusion of a trade deal with India is almost set now, with deals with both Japan and South Korea likely to follow in short order. That&#8217;s exactly what investors wanted to hear. The S&amp;P 500 is now up 0.7%, and so is &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; Trump Growls, Amazon Caves 12:13 pm Well, that was quick! No sooner had the White House expressed disapproval of an Amazon plan to inform customers of how much tariffs were raising the cost of goods sold on its site, than Amazon has abandoned the plan. Amazon spokesman Tim Doyle has just tossed the idea under the proverbial bus, admitting he &#8220;considered the idea&#8221; but it &#8220;was never approved and not going to happen.&#8221; Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (see above) commented: &#8220;Good move,&#8221; Amazon. Tariffs Threaten Supply Chain, Wall Street Shrugs 10:57 am Gene Seroka, the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, is warning of a &#8220;precipitous drop&#8221; in shipments from China as &#8220;major American retailers stop &#8230; all shipments from China based on the tariffs&#8221; announced by President Trump earlier this month. Despite the warning, investors have resumed buying stocks, and the S&amp;P 500 is now in positive territory, up 0.3%. Stock markets opened lower on Tuesday, threatening to break the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s five-day winning streak, although the market is moving back towards breakeven now. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.3% lower this morning, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) likewise opened down 0.3%. T In political news, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted a reported plan by Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), to display the cost of wares on its site next to the amount the cost was inflated by tariffs cost, as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Things could be worse, though. Last night, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised to &#8220;reward &#8230; companies who manufacture domestically&#8221; by reducing tariffs on foreign auto parts used to manufacture cars in the U.S. General Motors (NYSE: GM) CEO Mary Barra responded to the news by promising to &#8220;invest even more in the U.S. economy.&#8221; Ford (NYSE: F) CEO agreed that the move &#8220;will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers.&#8221; Earnings Speaking of General Motors, the automotive giant reported this morning that its Q1 profits came in at $2.78, $0.17 ahead of analyst forecasts. Commercial truckmaker Paccar (Nasdaq: PCAR) on the other hand reported profits $0.14 below forecasts. In housing, we see LGI Homes (Nasdaq: LGIH) miss badly, but paintmaker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) beat. In airlines, Jetblue Airways (Nasdaq: JBLU) reported a $0.59 per share loss, but this was $0.02 better than the $0.61 per share loss it was expected to report. Analyst Calls Analyst action is so far muted. Swiss bank UBS upgraded cranemaker Crane (NYSE: CR) to buy. Tariffs war and &#8220;market uncertainty&#8221; notwithstanding, UBS says it&#8217;s &#8220;increasingly confident in the long-term earnings outlook and M&amp;A opportunity&#8221; for the company. Not everyone&#8217;s so confident, however. Already this morning we&#8217;re seeing downgrades outnumber upgrades, with Stifel cutting Builders FirstSource (Nasdaq: BLDR) to neutral, Bank of America lowering ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), also to neutral, and TD Cowen downgrading GLP-1 drugs compounder Hims &amp; Hers (NYSE: HIMS) to hold, citing increased competition from Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and a lack of near-term catalysts to move the stock higher.

Hundreds of companies that went public a quarter of a century ago were losing money. When the capital available to them dried up, the shares of most collapsed, and some went out of business. Even companies with strong prospects, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), took share price beatings. Three factors would cause a deep drop in the market. The first is that the market is considered rich on multiple levels. The S&amp;P 500 PE is 26, which is high unless this year’s earnings are strong across the market. Two other things could crush the market. The first is hyperinflation, which tariffs, the equivalent of a tax on everything from cars to toys, would bring on. American household income will be unable to keep up with double-digit price surges. True hyperinflation occurs when prices go up 50%. Inflation hit the U.S. by 18% in 1980, driven to some extent by energy prices. The Fed raised rates to 19%. The economy was pounded into a recession from 1980 to 1982, and the stock market took a brutal beating. The other significant risk is an AI valuation implosion. Big tech shareholders already worry that the industry has invested more money in AI than it can get as a return on investment in the next few years. Companies have already prepared to invest tens of billions of dollars in server farms to expand because the US does not have that supply today. They have also invested or plan to put billions of dollars into Nvidia&#8217;s (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips. Nvidia&#8217;s value relies on that continuing. The more dangerous and harder-to-forecast problem is that AI could begin to threaten humans. It is not an edge case. Wide-regarded Scientific American recently wrote, “Artificial intelligence algorithms will soon reach a point of rapid self-improvement that threatens our ability to control them and poses great potential risk to humanity.” From an investor’s standpoint, AI could lose most, if not all, of its value, under those circumstances. It is hard to believe that the stock market could lose all of its value, but not that many decades ago, it did.

CHARLES, IL — The Whole Foods in St. Charles is inching closer to opening day. But, it's still unclear exactly when that will be. Russell Colby, director of community development for the city of St. Charles, said the city has issued a ""punch list"" of items during a final inspection that must not be completed before a building permit project is considered complete. ""Once the project is complete, the city can issue an occupancy permit to allow the building to be occupied. With an occupancy approval, the store would have the ability to begin stocking the store and bringing in employees,"" Colby said. The store is still planned to open in the spring, but a specific opening date has not been announced, he said. Meanwhile, hiring has gotten underway for a variety of positions at the store. Those interested in working for Whole Foods can apply here.  Fort Union, a regional development commercial specializing in grocery anchors, acquired the property in 2023 and entered into a lease agreement with Whole Foods Market, according to city officials. As part of upgrades to the site, parking lots around the store were reconstructed for future use by Whole Foods, including the city-owned parking lot located at the southwest corner of Illinois and First Streets. The sidewalks and landscaping around the parking lots were updated to add angled street parking, paver bricks, landscape beds and decorative lighting. In recent months, work has been done inside the store. As a part of the project approval, the city approved an incentive agreement to reimburse the developer for the cost of the parking lot and street/sidewalk improvements, according to city officials. In March 2022, the Blue Goose closed its doors for good. The store first opened in 1928.",https://www.patch.com/illinois/stcharles-il/whole-foods-update-when-will-st-charles-grocery-store-open

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a bare 0.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained a more substantial 0.7%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.2% gain. Despite an inauspicious start on Monday, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF&#8217;s gain of 0.7% Friday brought its total gain for the week to 4.6%. For the month of April, however, the Voo remains down 1.5%, with just three trading days remaining. Call It &quot;the Trump Effect&quot; 1:23 pm Markets have turned solidly green in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.66% and the Voo ETF ticking right along in its footsteps with a 0.64% gain. So what&#8217;s changed? Responding to China&#8217;s demurral yesterday that &#8220;there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,&#8221; which was itself in response to President Trump&#8217;s assertion Tuesday that talks were happening, the President insisted again today that, whatever the Chinese government may want people to believe, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been meeting with China&#8221; to talk about lowering tariffs after all. In this game of he said, Xi said, it&#8217;s honestly hard for an investor to know what&#8217;s really going on. But for now at least, the markets seem to believe Mr. Trump, and are hoping the trade war is nearing an end. S&amp;P 500 Just Turned Into a Horse of a Different Color 11:50 am Uh-oh. We&#8217;re 15 minutes from noonday now, and the S&amp;P 500 has just turned red, down 0.12%. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, likewise, has lost its pleasant shade of green, and is now down 0.14%. In happier news (for investors), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) just won a ruling in Texas, where an Outsourcing Facilities Association lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA suing them for making Ozempic copycat drugs just got rejected. S&amp;P 500 component Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) previously won a similar ruling, also in Texas. For the big publicly-traded GLP-1 drugmakers, things are finally going their way. S&amp;P Might Not Bounce Back This Time 10:52 am In mid-morning trading, we&#8217;re getting further disturbing news that may weigh on &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; CNBC reports that S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), or more precisely third party retailers who sell on Amazon, are raising prices on hundreds of items to help them absorb the cost of new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon&#8217;s stock price doesn&#8217;t seem to be suffering from the report yet. It&#8217;s still slightly in the green. But the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t moving any higher, despite trading having begun nearly an hour and a half ago already. And we&#8217;re off! The stock market opened for trading a bit lower today than it left off last night. But within five minutes of opening, the S&amp;P 500 (Index: SPX) was already, if only barely, in the green with an 0.06% gain. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO), which closely tracks the performance of the index, is up 0.09%. It&#8217;s still a hesitant start, but a logical result in light of comments from President Trump, just published by Time magazine, to the effect that the President is looking to end his trade war with China (and the world) perhaps &#8220;a year from now&#8221; and with tariffs on foreign countries settling at &#8220;20% to 50%.&#8221; The prospect of trade war volatility dragging on for another 12 months, and of tariffs ending up two to five times higher than the 10% &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariffs already announced, is clearly not something that investors wanted to hear. Earnings Last night, after the close of trading on a third straight day of gains for &#8220;the Voo,&#8221; index component Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG) (Nasdaq: GOOGL) reported earnings a staggering 40% better than Wall Street analysts were predicting, which seemed propitious enough news to keep the stock market rally going this morning. Unfortunately, comments from Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) seem to have canceled out Alphabet&#8217;s good news. The chipmaker reported a $0.19 per share loss for its own first quarter, warned that it&#8217;s not going to earn a profit in Q2 either (at best, Intel might break even), and its Q2 sales will be about $1 billion less than analysts had forecast. This mixed messaging on the earnings front, for two of the country&#8217;s biggest tech companies, is also weighing on the market today. Analyst Calls Perhaps unlucky for them, Wall Street analysts seem not to have had an opportunity to review the President&#8217;s comments before issuing their latest round of upgrades this morning. Citigroup for example is starting the day off with an upgrade of Hasbro (Nasdaq: HAS) stock, while KeyBanc is upgrading both Lowes (NYSE: LOW) and La-Z-Boy (NYSE: LZB) &#8212; all three of which companies are highly dependent upon goods imported from abroad. If the trade war keeps rumbling, and tariffs keep climbing, things could turn ugly for all of these stocks, and for the S&amp;P 500 in general.

CHARLES, IL — A new Whole Foods grocery stores is supposed to open this spring in St. Charles but company officials have not yet released the opening date. Patch.com reached out to Whole Foods this past week to see if the opening date has been set. On Monday, Carrie Rodgers, who works for corporate communications for Whole Foods, said the company did not have any information to share regarding the opening of the Whole Foods. Meanwhile, final inspections have been underway at the store, according to city officials. On Friday, city officials said a final inspection ""punch list"" has been provided to the contractor. Patch.com has reached out to community development officials to learn more about what else needs to be done before the grocery store opening. St. Fort Union, a regional development commercial specializing in grocery anchors, acquired the property in 2023 and entered into a lease agreement with Whole Foods Market, according to city officials. As part of upgrades to the site, parking lots around the store were reconstructed for future use by Whole Foods, including the city-owned parking lot located at the southwest corner of Illinois and First Streets. The sidewalks and landscaping around the parking lots were updated to add angled street parking, paver bricks, landscape beds and decorative lighting. In recent months, work has been done inside the store. As a part of the project approval, the city approved an incentive agreement to reimburse the developer for the cost of the parking lot and street/sidewalk improvements, according to city officials. In March 2022, the Blue Goose closed its doors for good. The store first opened in 1928.",https://www.patch.com/illinois/stcharles-il/no-word-whole-foods-opening-date

By turning him into a financial trading wizard, the drug propels him into the stratosphere of high finance. As Eddie relishes his luxurious lifestyle and newfound respect and admiration, he becomes addicted to the drug, the money, and the power, despite increasing mental blackouts, unexplained gaps in his memory, and the threat of mobsters seeking to steal the drug from him. While not a primary aspect of the plot, the underlying theme of addiction in multiple forms is reiterated on several levels while the escalation of the cycle and the difficulty in jumping off the carousel is also explored. It becomes a trap for Eddie, since the fear of returning to his previously humble and failing life outweighs the growing memory and mental problems being triggered by the drug. The threats to Eddie’s life by the Russian mob finally shock him into the realization as to how much else he risks by staying on the ever spinning hamster wheel he has created for himself. The fast track grind is unrelenting, and the temptation to remain on it often outweighs more rational concerns for one’s own mental and physical well-being. Just like a drug addiction, the craving for the momentary thrills of making big profits or collecting big paychecks subsumes common sense safeguards and rational behavior. Combating burnout, especially when finances are not the sole motivation, becomes trickier in identifying the causes and devising the solutions. Key Points The fast lane of 8-figure plus sized deals can be seductive and addictive, becoming a continuous cycle that is difficult to leave. Even with the commensurate financial rewards from a successful career managing huge sums, finding personal fulfillment on a deeper level can elude many who stay in the fast lane. A broader definition and discussion of the nature of success can be helpful in dealing with the pressure and mental toll from the challenges of maintaining the hamster wheel. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) “Maybe FatFIRE Isn’t About Freedom. Maybe It’s Just Wage Slavery In A Gucci Suit.” The inability to leave the fast track grind after building a net worth of $80 million indicates underlying deep seated insecurities and a prospective psychological and emotional burnout and meltdown. Surprisingly, some people who have achieved profound success can lament about how it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. A Reddit fan who is probably in the top 10% of the 1% richest people posted his personal impressions on the emptiness of reaching the pinnacle of the pyramid. His details were as follows: The poster claims his net worth is roughly $80 million. His assets include multiple liquid forms (i.e. stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) as well as private equity. The poster’s business is self-owned, so he has no boss, no Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metric hanging over his head, and no fixed 9-5 office hours. Contrary to his expectations, his success seems to have only migrated him to the same type of obligations and daily grind as when he was an employee. He finds his current situation is giving him the same stress and optimization addictions, albeit with “better wine, fancier vacations, and the illusion of control.” While no longer managing the funds of clients, the poster is now managing his own portfolio, putting him in the role of “CFO of his personal empire”, with added pressures and no other life beyond work. Ironically, he finds that the pursuit of FatFIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) has left him stuck on the hamster wheel, irrationally paranoid of becoming irrelevant if he jumps off. Redefining Success The first step in ending an addiction to the fast track is to consciously take a step back to reassess priorities and find oneself, which is something more than a job or its title. As one might expect, the range of responses was very broad. A number of the responses thought it was a LARP (Live Action Role Play) hoax, with some accusing the poster of actually being a ChatGPT Bot. Others were incredulous, finding the poster’s complaints to be hysterically funny, and thinking it was a ridiculous attempt at virtual signaling for victimhood amidst his $80 million accumulated wealth. Several unsympathetic respondents shot back with a mix of envy and resentment: “At $80 million, you’re working for your ego.” “Ego grows faster than wealth.” “Narcissists are in a prison of their own making.” “You need a life. Go find one.” “The problem is you.” “Cry me a river.” “If it helps you feel better, you’re already irrelevant.” “You made your business your personality and your identity. We all need something to bring us joy other than our job title.” To be fair to the skeptics, the poster apparently had posted 6 months ago asking for investment advice to allocate monthly savings to set up accounts for his kids. It’s doubtful that someone who legitimately has amassed $80 million net worth would not have professional financial advisors and estate planners under retainer already for such a purpose. That said, the topic is certainly a legitimate one that is not without precedent. There were some constructive critiques and helpful suggestions posted in response that are good food for thought: One respondent suggested a redefinition of success to extend beyond simply one’s self and making money to have consideration for others. Satisfaction can be found in creating a legacy to help one’s family for future generations. Type-A personalities who relish competing with their peers often don’t know how to live any other way, so taking a break to reset and assess priorities can offer some sorely needed respite. One respondent psychoanalyzed the poster as existentially running from death and filling the void with activity. Anxiety is expressed by the inability to say “no” to another board seat, etc. The RE part of FIRE is to retire into something with meaning. Not just quit your job once you’ve got enough cash. A former pro athlete advised that the only way to take the retirement plunge is to consciously take the step and be honest with yourself to help work through the reinvention process. Having a wealthy financial situation that affords one retirement options can include such activities as: Angel Investing, advising, charitable foundation management, as well as diversions, like travel, hobbies, meditation, fitness, and spending quality time with family and friends. From someone who conquered being in a similar predicament: Freedom isn’t absolute &#8211; it’s a spectrum we negotiate, often unconsciously. Unpacking the real you demands deep introspection and a step back from the C-suite treadmill. Unplug, strip away the noise, and rediscover your own voice. The stakes are low &#8211; you can always return to the grind if it calls. For you &#8211; success is the baseline. The real challenge is redefining it on your terms. Step off the track and recalibrate &#8211; the returns will outpace anything you’ve pitched in the boardroom. One respondent who had attained a similar net worth exited and put his holdings into 80/20 (growth/income) funds so he would have the freedom to travel, spend time with family, learn new skills and play video games. Several who lauded the poster’s choice to stay in the grind pointed out these observations: People who think it’s about ego are off-base. We work for our FUTURE SELVES, and our family. Jeff Bezos had to ask himself “What happens on Day 2?” after he retired from Amazon. Fearing Day 2 means the decision has yet to be truly made. It’s easier to decide to DO something than NOT to do something. If Elon quit after making $180 million with PayPal, we would never have Tesla, X, Starlink, SpaceX, or The Boring Company, so there’s nothing wrong with staying in the game when others might have dropped out earlier.

Ever since President Donald Trump announced his policy of reciprocal tariffs to level the international trade playing field, the stock and bond markets have both become cyclonic in their volatility. 2,000+ point intraday swings in either direction on the Dow Jones Average and a 50 basis point swing for the 10-year Treasury Bond yield in less than a month have given even veteran investors bouts of nausea. As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow.

Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Navigating Through A Huge Menu Of Selections The huge array of available investment selections can be intimidating and overwhelming neophyte investors. A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action. Taking a closer look at SCHD and VOO is probably a prudent step to accomplish this step. (All market quote details are as of the time of this writing.)

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.

Just in time for Record Store Day 2025, Larry Rosenbaum, 81, recalls the glory days of Flip Side Records, the greatest record store chain in Chicagoland history, that he co-founded with his brother, Carl, 83, in “The Flip Side: Where Chicago Rocked” (Eckharzt Press). From 1968 to 1995, Flip Side ruled Chicago’s record market, with locations tucked away in strip malls and storefronts across the city and suburbs. The concert arm of the Rosenbaum brothers’ enterprise was Celebration Flip Side, which produced all the big concerts of the 1970s and 1980s. Carl and Larry weren’t necessarily into music, growing up on Chicago’s North Side in West Ridge (West Rogers Park). They just wanted to be their own boss. “We were working for an electronics parts distributor in 1968,” Larry, 81, told Patch. “We were interested in going into business ourselves. Our choices were narrowed down to a record store, Vienna hot dog stand and a dry cleaner. Our dad was a CPA and one of his clients owned a lucrative dry cleaning business.” Both brothers were in their early 20s, married and with babies, because that’s what you did back then. “We decided on a record store,” Larry said. “Interestingly enough, we weren’t into music. We were just looking for a business to get into.” The brothers made a deal with the landlord for a former bakery on Foster Avenue between Kedzie and Kimball. “We were in the record business,” Larry said. Their stiffest competition was another record store four blocks away called Little Al’s Records that had been around forever. One day, when Larry was working on turning the bakery into a record store, he saw a big fat guy staring through the window. It was Little Al. “He took us out for coffee. He said he was going to do stuff to make us fail, but figured we’d just fail anyway,” Larry recalled. “At 22, it scared the crap out of me. From a competitive angle, here’s a big fat schlub coming in and telling us we were going to fail. We were each married with one kid. This was how we were going to make a living.” The brothers would go on to prove Little Al wrong. Looking for a name for their new venture, a young marketing executive, who lived in the apartment next door to Larry, came up with the name Flip Side. “The timing was great,” Larry said. “It was a great time to be in the music business, especially in the 1970s.” People line up in front of a Flip Side store in 1975, waiting to buy Rolling Stones tickets. Feeding the rock-crazed young consumers on Chicago’s Northwest Side, Carl came up with the idea to go over to the Aragon Ballroom in Uptown to sell records when rock acts were playing at the venue. “We made a deal with the owner,” Larry said. “Every weekend during shows, we’d pack up an old station wagon and set up in the corner.” Among the many innovations Flip Side contributed to the music biz was bringing Ticketron outlets — the original computerized ticket company — into the stores. The cover of the music business bio features a line of people outside a Flip Side store in 1975 waiting to buy tickets to see Rolling Stones at the Chicago Stadium. ""Because of the contacts we made at the Aragon, we ultimately got into the concert business ourselves, promoting concerts. Back in the 1970s, we were the premiere concert promoters in Chicago. We worked with the Loop, WCKG and WXRT. “We would contract with bands, sign the bands from the first step to the stage, from the Rollling Stones to the Who to Cheap Trick to Steve Martin,” Larry said. At its peak, Flip Side had 21 stores in Chicago, Hoffman Estates, Schaumburg, Buffalo Grove, Downers Grove, Naperville and Wheaton, to name a few. The Rosenbaums kept Flip Side going until 1995 when they closed their last store, after Best Buy and Circuit City entered the record biz. “[Best Buy and Circuit City] wanted to get people in their stores and used CDs as a loss-leader,” Larry said. “Within three years, they put every privately owned regional chain out of business. They killed the market. If you go to a Best Buy now, you can’t find any records or CDs. After a few years, both got out of the music business.” “The Flip Side: Where Chicago Rocked,” by Carl and Larry Rosenbaum, with Ken Churilla, is available through Erkhartz Press and Amazon. The oral history covers the life spans of the iconic record store chain as well as their concert business, encompassing the classic rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s. “The best way to sum it up, at least for my brother and me, to use the words of the Grateful Dead, 'what a long, strange trip it's been,'” Larry said. “It was a great run, the friends we made, the lives we impacted, there just isn’t any words.” In honor of Record Store Day Saturday, April 12, Larry Rosenbaum will be signing copies of the book from11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the legendary Val’s Halla, 239 Harrison St., Oak Park. After Oak Park, Larry will be zooming up to Scratched Vinyl, 119 Barrington Commons Court, Barrington, from 2 to 3 p.m. Record Store Day is a global event that celebrates the vanishing independent record shops, hallowed grounds that once flourished on street corners and downtown shopping districts during the pre-digital and streaming age. Special vinyl and CD exclusives and various promotional products are also made for the day, released only to independently owned record shops, along with RSD first and small run/regional releases.
