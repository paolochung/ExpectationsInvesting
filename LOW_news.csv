LOW,2025-06-10 13:18:25,Popular Home Improvement Chain Set To Open New Stores In 2025: Report,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/popular-home-improvement-chain-set-to-open-new-stores-20250610.jpg,https://www.patch.com,"MOORESVILLE, NC — Popular hardware and home improvement store chain Lowe's has opened a number of new stores in 2025 and plans to open more before the end of the year, according to a new report. Additionally, the chain also plans to open more stores in 2026, making it even easier for shoppers across the U.S. to purchase tools, appliances, building materials and more all under one roof. New Store Locations USA Today reports Lowe's plans to open five to 10 new stores this year, two of which have already opened in Magnolia and Fort Worth, Texas. Additionally, a store in Asheville, N.C., that was closed due to Hurricane Helene in September has since reopened. A Lowe's spokesperson also confirmed to USA Today the company plans to open new stores in Georgetown, Texas, and Maricopa, Ariz., later this year. According to a store directory on the company's website, Lowe's operates over 100 stores in Texas and more than 30 in Arizona. Lowe's also operates over 100 stores in North Carolina where the company is headquartered. More Stores To Come In December, Lowe's held its 2024 analyst and investor conference to provide updates on its key growth and productivity initiatives and near-term and long-term financial targets. During the event, the company announced plans to expand its footprint and attract new customers to the brand by opening 10 to 15 stores per year over the next several years in fast-growing markets in the U.S., according to a news release posted to the company's website. ""In planning this next phase of store expansion, the company will build on the success of its recent new store openings, while also leveraging its enhanced space productivity initiatives,"" the release reads. ""With these new stores, the company expects to strengthen its brand position, build its customer base and drive incremental sales and return on invested capital."" According to USA Today, the company's plans for five to 10 new stores in 2025 accounts for time needed to ramp up their opening efforts, and the projected 10 to 15 new stores per year will start in 2026. Store Openings In 2025 Lowe's is just one of several companies to recently announce expansion plans for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026. Furniture retailer IKEA confirmed in May the company has already opened four ""plan and order"" points with pick-up locations, as well as one pick-up point location, thus far in 2025. A company spokesperson said IKEA plans to open three more stores and three more plan and order point with pick up locations before the end of the year, and two more are already in the works for 2026. Walmart also confirmed last month about 10 new stores are scheduled to open by the end of 2025, five of which are set to open by September. Meanwhile, popular hot dog chain Wienerschnitzel confirmed plans to add restaurants to multiple Walmart stores, starting with six owned and operated by local high-caliber franchisees. Grocery store chain Wegmans Food Markets confirmed Friday plans to open a total of three stores this year, with one already open and two more scheduled to open this summer. Culver's, a beloved fast food chain specializing in burgers, chicken and frozen treats, has already opened new restaurants in 15 states thus far in 2025 and has broken ground on new restaurants planned for communities in 12 states. Restaurant chain Raising Cane's, which specializes in chicken finger meals and combos, recently announced plans for new locations in Massachusetts and Connecticut as the company continues to expand throughout the Northeast.",https://www.patch.com/us/across-america/popular-home-improvement-chain-set-open-new-stores-2025-report

This change has occurred worldwide, most notably in technologically advanced countries like America. We once ventured out to &#8220;run errands&#8221;, a frequent activity that often included a stop at the mall or a trip to the local boutique. But with Amazon reigning supreme and tons of huge brands like Walmart and Target focusing on online sales, the nature of shopping in America has been drastically altered. With online retail comes the opportunity to reach any segment of the population from anywhere in the world. As competition skyrockets, brand recognition, marketing, and advertising become crucial to a company&#8217;s success.

Depending on the exact score, these brands fell into 6 separate rankings: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a bare 0.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained a more substantial 0.7%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.2% gain. Despite an inauspicious start on Monday, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF&#8217;s gain of 0.7% Friday brought its total gain for the week to 4.6%. For the month of April, however, the Voo remains down 1.5%, with just three trading days remaining. Call It &quot;the Trump Effect&quot; 1:23 pm Markets have turned solidly green in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.66% and the Voo ETF ticking right along in its footsteps with a 0.64% gain. So what&#8217;s changed? Responding to China&#8217;s demurral yesterday that &#8220;there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,&#8221; which was itself in response to President Trump&#8217;s assertion Tuesday that talks were happening, the President insisted again today that, whatever the Chinese government may want people to believe, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been meeting with China&#8221; to talk about lowering tariffs after all. In this game of he said, Xi said, it&#8217;s honestly hard for an investor to know what&#8217;s really going on. But for now at least, the markets seem to believe Mr. Trump, and are hoping the trade war is nearing an end. S&amp;P 500 Just Turned Into a Horse of a Different Color 11:50 am Uh-oh. We&#8217;re 15 minutes from noonday now, and the S&amp;P 500 has just turned red, down 0.12%. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, likewise, has lost its pleasant shade of green, and is now down 0.14%. In happier news (for investors), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) just won a ruling in Texas, where an Outsourcing Facilities Association lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA suing them for making Ozempic copycat drugs just got rejected. S&amp;P 500 component Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) previously won a similar ruling, also in Texas. For the big publicly-traded GLP-1 drugmakers, things are finally going their way. S&amp;P Might Not Bounce Back This Time 10:52 am In mid-morning trading, we&#8217;re getting further disturbing news that may weigh on &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; CNBC reports that S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), or more precisely third party retailers who sell on Amazon, are raising prices on hundreds of items to help them absorb the cost of new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon&#8217;s stock price doesn&#8217;t seem to be suffering from the report yet. It&#8217;s still slightly in the green. But the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t moving any higher, despite trading having begun nearly an hour and a half ago already. And we&#8217;re off! The stock market opened for trading a bit lower today than it left off last night. But within five minutes of opening, the S&amp;P 500 (Index: SPX) was already, if only barely, in the green with an 0.06% gain. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO), which closely tracks the performance of the index, is up 0.09%. It&#8217;s still a hesitant start, but a logical result in light of comments from President Trump, just published by Time magazine, to the effect that the President is looking to end his trade war with China (and the world) perhaps &#8220;a year from now&#8221; and with tariffs on foreign countries settling at &#8220;20% to 50%.&#8221; The prospect of trade war volatility dragging on for another 12 months, and of tariffs ending up two to five times higher than the 10% &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariffs already announced, is clearly not something that investors wanted to hear. Earnings Last night, after the close of trading on a third straight day of gains for &#8220;the Voo,&#8221; index component Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG) (Nasdaq: GOOGL) reported earnings a staggering 40% better than Wall Street analysts were predicting, which seemed propitious enough news to keep the stock market rally going this morning. Unfortunately, comments from Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) seem to have canceled out Alphabet&#8217;s good news. The chipmaker reported a $0.19 per share loss for its own first quarter, warned that it&#8217;s not going to earn a profit in Q2 either (at best, Intel might break even), and its Q2 sales will be about $1 billion less than analysts had forecast. This mixed messaging on the earnings front, for two of the country&#8217;s biggest tech companies, is also weighing on the market today. Analyst Calls Perhaps unlucky for them, Wall Street analysts seem not to have had an opportunity to review the President&#8217;s comments before issuing their latest round of upgrades this morning. Citigroup for example is starting the day off with an upgrade of Hasbro (Nasdaq: HAS) stock, while KeyBanc is upgrading both Lowes (NYSE: LOW) and La-Z-Boy (NYSE: LZB) &#8212; all three of which companies are highly dependent upon goods imported from abroad. If the trade war keeps rumbling, and tariffs keep climbing, things could turn ugly for all of these stocks, and for the S&amp;P 500 in general.

LOW,2025-04-16 12:30:14,Why Do Chase Shopping Offers Feel Blah Compared to Capital One’s 100+ Deals?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/why-do-chase-shopping-offers-feel-blah-compared-to-20250416.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the world of cash-back credit cards, Chase and Capital One are undoubtedly two of the best places to start. With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it’s concerning that this isn’t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it’s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy’s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I’m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You’ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster’s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One’s layout is far easier to navigate, but it’s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn’t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache.
