You can listen in here if you&#8217;d like. The stock is currently down 3.4%. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that almost every major stock reporting tonight is seeing red after-hours. Lululemon is down 22%, DocuSign is down 16%, and Rubrik jumped 6% after its earnings were released. However, its shares are now flat. Translation: After a furious two-month stock market rally, investors expectations for what companies should be delivering has risen. If any material news impacts Broadcom&#8217;s share price during its conference call we&#8217;ll post an update. One Standout Figure from Broadcom&#039;s Earnings 4:41 pm by Eric Bleeker One figure to pay attention to is that Broadcom is guiding to AI revenue next quarter of $5.1 billion, that&#8217;s above Wall Street&#8217;s expectations of $4.8 billion. Keep in mind that Broadcom&#8217;s stock has moved significantly in recent quarters based on conference call commentary, so where it&#8217;s trading right now (-2.5%) could be very different than where it opens tomorrow if the company&#8217;s CEO gives some especially bullish comments about future AI demand. It&#039;s a Beat and Raise for Broadcom - So Why Aren&#039;t Shares Moving? 4:37 pm by Joel South Broadcom issued a beat and raise for tonight&#8217;s earnings, not only surpassing last quarter&#8217;s expectations from Wall Street, but also topping guidance. So why aren&#8217;t the share moving north after-hours? Simply put, Broadcom has rallied a remarkable 78% since April 4th, so plenty of optimism was built in headed into these earnings. A slight beat and guide for the coming quarter above consensus is generally expected when stocks have rallied as furiously as Broadcom has in recent months. Make no mistake, Broadcom&#8217;s quarter was solid and its guidance for next quarter points to continuing momentum. However, the results are also not far enough above consensus to move the needle much after Broadcom&#8217;s recent run. Broadcom Shares are Rebounding 4:29 pm by Joel South Broadcom shares are rebounding, now roughly flat after initially dropping several percent after the company&#8217;s earnings release. Shares Slide Despite Record Q2 Results on Surging AI Demand 4:26 pm by Joel South Broadcom posted strong Q2 results, with revenue climbing 20% year-over-year to a record $15 billion, fueled by rapid growth in AI semiconductor demand and contributions from VMware. The company reported GAAP net income of $5 billion and non-GAAP net income of $7.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 35% to $10.0 billion, representing 67% of revenue. AI revenue reached $4.4 billion in Q2, up 46% from the previous year, and is projected to grow further to $5.1 billion in Q3. CEO Hock Tan noted continued investment from hyperscale partners and 10 straight quarters of AI revenue growth. Broadcom also generated $6.4 billion in free cash flow, returning $7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. The company expects Q3 revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and maintains strong profitability guidance. Despite this, shares slipped in after-hour trading 28.6% from the close. Execution Risks 3:33 pm by Joel South Despite strong momentum, Broadcom’s Q2 setup is not without potential downside risks. The most immediate is hyperscaler AI capex cyclicality. While demand remains strong, cloud buildouts can be lumpy, and any signal of Q3 digestion or budget reallocation — especially in networking — could imply slower sequential growth, even if the long-term trajectory remains intact. On the software side, customer churn within VMware remains a meaningful risk. Broadcom’s go-to-market changes — including consolidation of SKUs and tighter bundling — could alienate long-time customers, especially in segments like EUC (End-User Computing) that are being divested or deemphasized. If bookings slow or renewal rates dip below plan, the market may question whether VMware revenue is truly durable. Another issue is regulatory scrutiny and deal pipeline constraints. Broadcom has long relied on M&amp;A to build scale and pricing power. But with global regulators now increasingly aggressive, further transformative acquisitions could face long timelines or outright rejection, limiting long-term inorganic growth potential. Finally, valuation has expanded significantly. The stock trades at ~25x forward EPS — toward the high end of its historical range. That leaves limited room for error on the Q2 results or full-year guide. If margins contract, or if guidance remains unchanged despite tailwinds, the bar may prove too high. Keys to Watch 3:32 pm by Joel South 1. GenAI Ethernet Momentum and ASP Trends:The durability of Broadcom’s AI networking tailwind is the single most important question heading into this release. Investors want to know if demand from hyperscalers is accelerating, stabilizing, or softening — and whether AVGO is gaining share vs. InfiniBand-based alternatives like Nvidia’s Mellanox stack. A beat in networking and bullish comments on demand visibility into 2H FY24 would reinforce Broadcom’s role as a backbone infrastructure supplier for AI training and inference clusters. 2. VMware Margins, Churn, and Booking Signals:While headline growth will be boosted by VMware consolidation, investors care more about how profitable those dollars are. If VMware segment operating margin exceeds 60% or gross margin trends toward the high-70s, the software synergy thesis gains credibility. Watch closely for commentary on customer renewals, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), and any soft patches in product overlap areas. 3. Guidance Lift and Fiscal Discipline:Management has guided conservatively over the past year, often beating internally restrained expectations. If Broadcom raises its full-year revenue outlook to $51B or above and holds EBITDA margin at 60%, it would confirm confidence in both software execution and sustained AI spend. That could justify further multiple expansion in the mid-20x EPS range. Core Results &amp; Segment Highlights 3:31 pm by Joel South Q2 FY2024 Street Estimates: Revenue: $12.04B Adjusted EPS: $10.84 YoY Revenue Growth: +37.6% Adj. Gross Margin (guide): ~75% Adj. EBITDA Margin (guide): 60% FY24 (Implied): Full-Year Revenue Guide (prior): $50B AI Infrastructure Run-Rate (last disclosed): $1B/quarter VMware Contribution Estimate (Q2): ~$2.3B Legacy Semiconductor Core (ex-VMware): ~$9.7B Broadcom has beaten Street EPS estimates in each of the last 12 quarters. Last quarter, it reported EPS of $10.99 on $11.96B in revenue, exceeding guidance on both lines and attributing the strength primarily to AI-related Ethernet demand and an unexpectedly smooth start to VMware integration. This quarter, analysts are expecting flat-to-up sequential trends in networking, mid-single-digit growth in broadband, and mid-teens growth in wireless — all consistent with seasonal patterns. Software is expected to rise sharply YoY due to VMware, but investors will differentiate between organic Broadcom software and new VMware revenue. Most expect VMware to contribute &gt;$2B per quarter with 70–75% gross margin and 55–60% EBITDA margin — if Broadcom delivers higher, that would confirm synergy realization is ahead of pace. Notably, guidance will carry more weight than the headline numbers. Street models are anticipating an update to full-year revenue closer to $51B and potential EBITDA upside if VMware cost actions flow through earlier than planned. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) enters its Q2 FY2024 earnings release as one of the most closely watched semiconductor and infrastructure software plays, sitting squarely at the intersection of two defining technology narratives: hyperscale AI infrastructure deployment and large-scale software consolidation. Expectations are high across the board, and the stock has reflected that enthusiasm — surging over 30% in the past month to all-time highs, with investors pricing in both generative AI upside and a smooth VMware integration path. Analysts are modeling $12.04B in revenue (+37.6% YoY) and $10.84 in adjusted EPS, with roughly $2.3B expected from VMware in its first full quarter post-acquisition. The remainder of the growth is expected to come from AI-enabling components — especially Broadcom’s switch ASICs, custom silicon, and Ethernet fabric interconnects, which are widely deployed by hyperscale customers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The company previously disclosed that GenAI-related sales were running at a $1B quarterly pace — and any update on that figure will be a core focus. Broadcom’s results will serve as a high-stakes litmus test for enterprise AI infrastructure demand, especially given recent mixed signals from peers. Nvidia has flagged broad-based hyperscaler spend, while Marvell noted pushouts. Broadcom’s exposure is deeper in networking, and the expectation is for that segment to grow over 50% YoY, barring any cloud digestion pause. Just as important is the VMware narrative. Management previously guided to 60% EBITDA margins on a combined basis and expressed confidence that early cost synergies would materialize faster than expected. But as VMware customer contracts turn over, the Street wants proof that Broadcom can retain revenue while simplifying the product portfolio. Any sign of subscription churn or integration friction could undercut the broader software platform thesis.

Wall Street Bullish on This Big Tech Stock 9:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts have turned increasingly bullish on Amazon stock. Here&#8217;s a roundup of the most recent analyst moves: Earlier this week, BofA reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN and raised its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts highlighted Amazon’s advancements in robotics and AI, noting these could add approximately 2 percentage points to retail margins, supporting further upside. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating and increased its price target from $225 to $240. The firm emphasized Amazon’s leadership in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), along with margin tailwinds and a strong free cash flow (FCF) ramp, fueling a bullish long-term outlook. Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $240, noting that delays in Amazon’s Project Kuiper (satellite internet initiative) are expected and priced into the stock. They expressed confidence in Amazon’s 2025 launch cadence and cost guidance for the project. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain fickle, but today there is reason to be optimistic. Discussions have reemerged between the White House and Beijing, according to Chinese media reports.

Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been capturing attention lately, most recently for announcing a $10 billion bet on AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock is up 1.7% today. Additionally, the markets are keeping an eye on the broader S&amp;P 500 index, which will announce changes to its member lineup on Friday. Bank of America has offered its two cents, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) could muscle their way into the index.

NVDA,2025-06-04 16:10:02,Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/palantir-technologies-nasdaq-pltr-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-20250604.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) gained 5.31% over the past five trading days, bringing its one-month gain to 6.21%. Year-to-date, the stock is up an eye-catching 74.53%, and over the past year, it has gained an absurd 495%. While the stock&#8217;s forward P/E ratio — currently 238.10 — can be concerning, Palantir&#8217;s federal contracts and aerospace ties are expected to continue fueling growth. While earnings are rear-facing, the emerging trends seen in the company&#8217;s Q1 results can serve as a foundation for further rewards for shareholders. In the first quarter, Palantir saw year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. U.S. commercial business surpassed a $1 billion run rate, good for 71% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year. PLTR&#8217;s market multiple implies it could take an investor nearly half a century to recover their initial investment, assuming earnings remained constant. But the assumption from the company — and from Wall Street analysts — is that earnings will continue to grow. EPS in Q1 2024, for example, stood at 8 cents, while EPS in Q1 2025 rose to 13 cents, good for an increase of 62.5%. So while there is concern about its valuation, what can investors expect from Palantir over the next year? 24/7 Wall St. did some analysis, so let’s take a look at. Key Points in This Article: Palantir&#8217;s government line of business accounts for more than half of its revenue, with existing contracts between the AI firm and the U.S. Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Agriculture, the FBI, the CDC, the U.S. Army and the UK&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, to name a handful. The company&#8217;s explosive commercial revenue growth shows that it is capable of sustainably scaling without being overly reliant upon federal contracts. It also provides services to numerous industries, including energy, data protection, health and life sciences, insurance, hospital operations, retail, semiconductors, telecommunications and utilities, among others. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Palantir? The AI environment is ripe for growth, though, of which Palantir should play a major part. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $1.811 trillion by the end of the decade, good for a 35.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2025 and 2030. The global market size of AI in 2024 was $279.2 billion, meaning at that forecasted CAGR, by the end of 2025, the market should expand to $379.4 billion. Companies like Palantir that focus on broad AI applications in diverse industries should see the lion&#8217;s share of that growth. This industry growth potential is one reason Palantir provided strong guidance in its Q1 earnings call, stating that it expects 36% revenue growth, with free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Not only has the company seen sizable growth, it forecasts sustainable momentum that will help continue that pattern over the course of the next year. Palantir’s government segment, which contributes 55% of revenue, grew 45% year-over-year in Q1 2025 to $373 million. High-profile contracts, like the recently signed ICE deal and NATO’s adoption of its AI-enabled military system, highlight its critical role in national security. President Trump&#8217;s emphasis on defense and government efficiency, exemplified by the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, positions Palantir as a go-to AI software provider, boosting investor confidence amid tariff-related market challenges. Additionally, the company&#8217;s commercial segment has skyrocketed, with U.S. commercial revenue up 71% year-over-year to $255 million in Q1 2025. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, empowers enterprises in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing to harness AI for data analytics. Strategic partnerships and 139 deals worth $1 million or more in Q1 (31 were over $10 million) demonstrate Palantir’s private-sector expansion, helping to drive stock gains. Palantir’s focus on operational efficiency has improved profitability, with adjusted operating margins expanding to 36% in Q1 2025 from 29% in 2024. Its software-as-a-service model, with high-margin recurring revenue, supports scalability across government and commercial clients. The company’s ability to deploy AIP rapidly, as shown by a 69% increase in customer count to 593, enhances revenue predictability. This profitability, coupled with $3.9 billion in cash reserves, fuels R&amp;D and market expansion, reinforcing investor optimism. Palantir (PLTR) as a Stock Since its IPO, Palantir has seen uncommon and exponential share appreciation, rising more than 1,300% since going public on Oct. 2, 2020. An enormous part of that growth came between February 2023 and February 2025, before the market began to correct this year. After reaching its all-time-high on Feb. 18, shares of PLTR fell by more than 40% before bottoming on April 4. But for patient, buy-and-hold investors, they have already been rewarded as the stock has pushed back up and established new all-time highs. Following the company&#8217;s Q1 earnings report, Royal Bank of Canada and Deutsche Bank reiterated their &#8220;Underperform&#8221; and &#8220;Sell&#8221; ratings, respectively, on the AI data analytics firm. Most other analysts, though, maintained their &#8220;Hold&#8221; ratings. A notable exception was Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a PLTR perma-bull who reiterated his buy call, saying Plantar is&#8221;one of our top tech names to own&#8221; and setting a $140 per share price target. Broadly, 18 Wall Street analysts assign the stock a consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating, with three analysts giving it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 11 giving it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and four giving it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. However, price targets for the AI darling represent a vast spread of opinions, with the high-end price target at $140, the median price target at $100.13 and the low-end price target at $40. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $40 -69.69% Median $1o0.13 -24.12% High $150 13.66% Palantir Technologies 2025 Outlook Palantir has made several important announcements over the past few weeks, including a $30 million contract with ICE to develop a system to help with deportations, and a partnership with TWG Global and xAI to bring AI to the financial services industry. That news has driven the stock higher in the short term. But as the broad market&#8217;s outlook remains clouded, so too does Palantir&#8217;s. That is reflected in Wall Street&#8217;s consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. The coming year for Palantir&#8217;s stock performance will continue to be shaped by the contracts it wins, both with the government and the private sector. Analysts project a 35% increase in revenue to $3.88 billion this year, though PLTR raised its guidance to $3.89 billion to $3.9 billion, up from its prior forecast of $3.74 billion to $3.75 billion. Palantir calls for a minimum 68% jump in commercial revenue to $1.178 billion, with CEO Alex Karp saying, &#8220;We are delivering the operating system for the modern enterprise in the era of AI.&#8221; While Palantir does face competition from both large AI Big Data forms, as well as smaller, fast-growing AI data analytics shops, the company can be seen as having an entrenched position within government and large enterprises. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Palantir Technologies is less bearish at $107, which represents 18.92% potential downside from the stock&#8217;s current price. Those figures are based on Palantir having developed the premier AI software, but the decreasing cost of AI and expansion of large language models to lower barriers to entrance in decision-making software. We see projected revenue growth rates moderating over time climb from $3.9 billion in 2025 to $11.9 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $0.58 in 2025 to $1.44 in 2030.

Sour Apple 2:05 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street analyst firm is taking aim at Big Tech stock Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL). Needham analysts believe AAPL shares are too frothy, downgrading shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; The analyst firm also withdrew its price target of $225 per share, saying that the $170-$180 range reflects a more reasonable entry point. AAPL shares are relatively flat today. The Nasdaq Composite is holding onto a gain of 0.43%. Citi Downgrades This Nuclear Stock 11:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Citi has downgraded shares of Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG) on the heels of the utility&#8217;s long-term power arrangement with Big Tech company Meta (Nasdaq: META). Citi analysts attached a high-risk label to CEG stock, saying that it will miss out on premium pricing for its nuclear power, with a price target of $318. After yesterday&#8217;s rally, CEG shares are falling 2.8% today. The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.25% as of mid-morning trading. Wall Street Improves Market Outlook 9:51 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 nearly in the rearview mirror, Wall Street analysts are coming out in droves to revise their year-end forecasts. Most recently, Barclays has updated its S&amp;P 500 year-end outlook by close to 3% to 6,050 compared with a previous target of below 6,000. In addition to Barclays, other analysts firms that have lifted their 2025 S&amp;P 500 targets of late include Deutsche Bank and RBC. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets appear to be shrugging off some lackluster labor market data, with all three of the major stock market averages higher as of early morning trading. Yesterday, the markets managed to turn things around, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tacking on its fourth-straight winning session while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 also gained ground. Today, most sectors of the economy are higher, led by technology with a 1.48% advance. Nvidia&#8217;s (Nasdaq: NVDA) muscled Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) out of the way to reclaim the top of the most valuable company in the world rankings, with a market capitalization of $3.45 trillion. Traders are debating whether NVDA stock will see new highs in the near future. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 62.83 (+0.22%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 50.28 (+0.26%) S&amp;P 500: Up 14.10 (+0.24%) Economic Headwinds Private sector hiring lost momentum in May, with payrolls expanding by a mere 37,000 jobs. Results fell short of April&#8217;s 60,000 gain and also missed the Dow Jones forecast of 110,000 by a wide margin. In a sobering sign for the labor market, it marked the lowest monthly job creation from the ADP report in over two years. Meanwhile, the picture for wages remained largely static compared with the prior month&#8217;s results. President Trump is increasing pressure on Jerome Powell to lower interest rates following the weaker-than-expected private sector jobs data, saying the Fed chairman should have already taken this action. Market Movers Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is racing ahead by 15.8% today, extending yesterday&#8217;s gains on a positive full-year outlook. Fellow discount retailer Dollar Tree (NYSE: DLTR) is gaining 6% on the day on similarly upbeat guidance. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is gaining 2.7% today, recouping some recently lost ground.

Analysts at Citi now classify CEG stock as high-risk, arguing that the company will forgo the opportunity for premium pricing on its nuclear-generated electricity.

S&amp;P Outlook Looking Up 10:05 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first half of 2025 almost behind us, Wall Street analysts are actively revising their year-end market forecasts.

NVDA,2025-06-03 13:30:07,"These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-20250603.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points A &#8220;more is better&#8221; approach can help you diversify your portfolio while generating passive income. Five fascinating funds will tempt income seekers with potent yields and strong growth prospects. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Stock picking is fine, but exchange traded funds (ETFs) can enable immediate diversification without sacrificing growth and income opportunities. By selecting multiple funds instead of just one, you can achieve an extra measure of safety while also turning your portfolio into a veritable income-generating machine. The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/03/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-passive-income-machines/

GM (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F) are lower by 4% and 3%, respectively, as steel import tariffs come into focus. The SPY ETF is currently higher by 0.11%. Factory Sector Slowdown 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. manufacturing activity continued its deceleration in May, marking the third consecutive month of contraction. The Manufacturing PMI registered 48.5%, a slight dip from 48.7% in April. This index, which reflects the health of both the manufacturing and services sectors, signals ongoing weakness. Not surprisingly, the imports segment plunged to its lowest level in almost two decades. Against this backdrop of slowing economic indicators, stocks remain under pressure, including a 1.2% decline in Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW). Conversely, the price of gold is surging, up 2.5% to exceed $3,400 per ounce, as investors increasingly seek a safe haven amidst growing signs of an economic slowdown. The SPY ETF is down 0.08%. S&amp;P 500 Hunts Bottom 10:12 am by Gerelyn Terzo As the first half of 2025 nears the end, some Wall Street analysts are revising their S&amp;P 500 targets. Most recently, RBC analysts have increased their year-end S&amp;P 500 target to 5,730, up from 5,550. However, the prediction, made by RBC&#8217;s Lori Calvasina, suggests the broader market index has another 3% to fall based on last week&#8217;s closing level. The SPY index remains under pressure and is currently lower by 0.42%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are starting off the month of June under pressure. Technology stocks have reversed earlier gains, leaving all three of the major stock market averages lower as of mid-morning trading, including the S&amp;P 500. The overwhelming sentiment among traders and investors is one of tariff-war uncertainty amid rising tensions between the White House and China over a previously reached short-term tariff agreement. In response, stocks are lower and while Treasury yields are being pushed higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield experiencing a 2-basis-point bump to 4.4%. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is currently down 0.60%. Despite the tariff uncertainty, the markets quietly moved higher last month. May witnessed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advance over 9%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed higher by 6% and 4%, respectively. Technology stocks fueled much of the gains, led by Big Tech leaders such as Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT). Market Movers Steel stocks are bucking the downward trend in today&#8217;s markets. The Trump administration announced a doubling of tariffs on steel imports to 50%, a move directly benefiting U.S. steelmakers. Today, Cleveland-Cliffs is soaring over 22%, Steel Dynamics (Nasdaq: STLD) is up 13.4%, and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) has climbed 11.7%. This sector-wide rally is providing a strong lift to the VanEck Steel ETF, which is up 3% today. Turning to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, analysts predict that Dow component Boeing (NYSE: BA) could ride some tariff-related tailwinds. Bank of America has upgraded BA shares to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a revised price target of $260, a notable jump from its previous $185. BofA analysts suggest the White House may strategically leverage Boeing&#8217;s jetliners as a key negotiating asset in upcoming trade discussions. As a result, BA stock is currently gaining 1.7% The post S&#038;P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) Live: Markets Kick Off June in the Doldrums After China Trade Tensions Resurface appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/sp-500-nysearca-spy-live-markets-kick-off-june-in-the-doldrums-after-china-trade-tensions-resurface/
NVDA,2025-06-03 10:04:43,"These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-20250603.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, and MSTY offer eye-catching yields for ambitious passive income investors. You can try all four of these high-yield ETFs for diversified exposure to a wide range of stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In recent years, ultra-high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs) have opened the door to new possibilities for aggressive income harvesters. If you pick your ETFs carefully, you can practically turn your portfolio into a passive income machine. Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-passive-income-machines/

NVDA,2025-05-29 09:42:49,5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens on Thursday,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-on-20250529.jpg,https://www.investopedia.com,"Close U.S. stock futures are pointing sharply higher after a federal court struck down President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are jumping in premarket trading after the chipmaker posted record revenue that tops analysts' estimates; Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk says he has ended his government work; and Salesforce (CRM) reports better-than-expected results and lifts its full-year outlook. Here's what investors need to know today. 1. US Stock Futures Rise Following Court Ruling on Tariffs U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after a U.S. court ruling struck down President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs and Nvidia posted record revenue. Nasdaq futures are 1.4% higher after the tech-focused index slipped by 0.5% in the prior session as stocks fell ahead of Nvidia's earnings report. S&P 500 futures are up about 1% in early trading while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.4% higher. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade near $109,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is up at around 4.51%. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are little changed. 2. Federal Court Strikes Down Trump's 'Reciprocal' Tariffs A federal court late Wednesday struck down the ""reciprocal"" tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on the country's trading partners in early April, saying he had overstepped his authority. A three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Congress is typically responsible for imposing these levies and not the president alone. The ruling stopped Trump from enforcing the tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China that were aimed at combating fentanyl entering the U.S. The steel and aluminum tariffs Trump imposed in March weren't mentioned in the ruling. The White House immediately appealed the ruling, per reports. 3. Nvidia Stock Jumps on Soaring Revenue Despite Chip Restrictions Nvidia (NVDA) shares are jumping 6% in premarket trading after the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue rose to a record high, even as profit missed analysts' expectations because of export curbs. Nvidia reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share on revenue that jumped 69% year-over-year to $44.06 billion. While its quarterly sales exceeded analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, its profit did not, as Nvidia said it absorbed a $4.5 billion charge due to restrictions on the sale of its H20 chips to China. In the current quarter, Nvidia expects to take an $8 billion hit due to lost revenue from H20 sales. 4. Tesla CEO Musk Announces End to Government Role Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said in a post on his social media site X that his time at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ended. The announcement comes after he said earlier this week that he would return to ""spending 24/7 at work"" after investors had raised questions over whether the government position was distracting his focus from Tesla and his other companies. Musk announced in April that he would spend less time on work related to DOGE. Tesla shares are up more than 2% in premarket trading. 5. Salesforce Tops Q1 Expectations, Raises Full-Year Outlook Salesforce (CRM) on Wednesday reported first-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations and lifted its full-year outlook. The cloud software giant raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 revenue and adjusted EPS, citing demand for its AI products. Salesforce reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.58 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year rise to $9.83 billion, both above Visible Alpha consensus. Salesforce shares, which entered Thursday down 17% this year, are little changed in premarket trading. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Great Expectations 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo A cautious tone persists in today&#8217;s trading, with the three major stock market averages slightly in the red. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) shares are up 0.33% ahead of its highly anticipated quarterly earnings report expected after the closing bell. The prevailing sentiment is that Nvidia will once again exceed expectations and upgrade its guidance due to strong AI and chip demand. Yet, concerns linger regarding a potential write-down linked to China revenues, even with overall strong demand. The SPY ETF is lower by 0.16%. Consumer Spending on Deck 10:49 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive greater insight on the resilience of the consumer this week. Personal Income and Spending data for April is due out on Friday. This data follows a period of robust consumer spending observed in March. Economists at Wells Fargo anticipate a 0.3% increase in personal income and a 0.2% rise in personal spending. SPY is currently lower by 0.24%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets are treading carefully today, following yesterday&#8217;s powerful surge driven by news of EU import tariff delays. The spotlight is now firmly on corporate earnings, particularly those of chip giant Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), whose highly anticipated quarterly results are due after the market closes. Early morning trading shows stocks with minimal direction, as the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all registering modest gains. The SPY ETF is down 0.11% as of mid-morning trading. Here&#8217;s a look at the SPY over the past five trading sessions: The &#8220;Magnificent Seven&#8221; stocks are largely flat, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) up 1% and the rest of the cohort seeing mixed trading. GameStop (NYSE: GME) has dipped 3.5% today after venturing into the cryptocurrency space with its initial bitcoin acquisition exceeding $500 million, mirroring moves by MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has offloaded some TSLA shares while increasing its stake in Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings announcement. Elon Musk attempted to soothe investor concerns by posting about his relentless work schedule. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 22.97 (-0.05%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 9.71 (-0.05%) S&amp;P 500: Down 2.27 (-0.04%) Market Movers Retailer Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) is down 2.7% today, having cut its profit outlook amidst tariff-related challenges and cautious consumer sentiment. Conversely, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) is surging by 25.9% after easily beating its first-quarter earnings estimates. Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY), an electric air taxi firm, has climbed 26% following a $250 million strategic investment from automaker Toyota Motor. After initially rising above $127 per share, identity management company Okta (Nasdaq: OKTA) is now down 12% in the wake of its quarterly results, experiencing profit-taking. Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE: FICO) is recovering recent losses and is up 6.8% today.

Biotech Benefits from Generative AI 2:02 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Jefferies believes certain biotechnology stocks are poised to benefit from AI advancements. Analyst Michael Yee told CNBC that the sector is likely to save billions of dollars as well as time in getting drugs to market thanks to the role of generative AI in drug discovery. The firm is bullish on biotech stocks for the rest of 2025, saying any bad news is already built into the sector. The Nasdaq Composite is basically flat ahead of Nvidia&#8217;s earnings. Market Update 12:33 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks are continuing to play it safe in today&#8217;s trading session, with the three major stock market averages fractionally lower across the board. VP JD Vance is headlining today&#8217;s Bitcoin 2025 event, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift the BTC price, which is up about 0.17%. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock is up 0.33% today ahead of its quarterly earnings report due out this afternoon. The markets have come to expect Nvidia beating expectations and raising its guidance on strong AI and chip demand. Demand has been strong, but one area of concern is a write-down tied to China revenues. The Nasdaq Composite is currently down 0.09%. Personal Income &amp; Spending Preview 10:38 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets will receive another dose of economic data on Friday when the Personal Income and Spending report for the month of April is released. The report will come on the heels of strong consumer spending in March. Wells Fargo economists forecast personal income growth of 0.3% and personal spending to rise 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.18%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are playing it cautious following yesterday&#8217;s strong rally fueled by EU import tariff delays. Today all eyes are on corporate America, more specifically semiconductor leader Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), which reports its highly anticipated quarterly results after the closing bell. Stocks are showing little conviction in early morning trading, with the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posting fractional gains. The Magnificent Seven stocks are little changed, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) posting a 1% gain and the rest of the group trading mixed. GameStop (NYSE: GME) is down 3.5% on the day after expanding its footprint into the cryptocurrency markets with its maiden bitcoin purchase worth over $500 million, taking a page from the books of MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). ARK Invest has unloaded some TSLA shares while buying more Nvidia ahead of the AI leader&#8217;s earnings report. Elon Musk attempted to reassure investors by posting that he is working around the clock. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 54.20 (+0.13%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 43.57 (+0.23%) S&amp;P 500: Up 9.99 (+0.17%) Market Movers Retailer Macy&#8217;s (NYSE: M) is down 2.7% today after slashing its profit forecast amid tariff-related headwinds and consumer skittishness. On the flip side, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE: ANF) is soaring by 25.9% after handily surpassing Q1 earnings estimates. Joby Aviation (NYSE: JOBY), an electric air taxi company, is up 26% after receiving a $250 million strategic investment from automaker Toyota Motor. After the stock initially climbed above $127 per share, Identity management company Okta (Nasdaq: OKTA) is experiencing a 12% decline on the heels of its quarterly results amid profit taking.

Both stocks have rallied by double-digit percentages in recent days. President Trump is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and tighten the window for new reactor license approvals to 18 months, a process that traditionally is infamous for being extremely lengthy. The markets are holding their gains, including a 2.1% advance in the Nasdaq Composite. Consumer Confidence Soars 10:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer Confidence surged in May, hitting 98 – a significant 12.3-point jump from April. This robust reading defied economists&#8217; predictions of 86, despite ongoing tariff concerns. The markets are widening their lead, including a nearly 2% jump in the Nasdaq Composite. Durable Goods Orders Reverse 9:55 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders fell 6.3% last month, a narrower decline than economists had anticipated but on the heels of four straight monthly increases. The latest data is a gauge on business spending in light of the tariffs. Boeing (NYSE: BA) orders were a drag, falling 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Optimism has seeped back into the markets, with all three of the major stock market averages coming out of the gate higher. President Trump announced a pause on proposed EU tariffs until July 9, fueling a 300-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Technology stocks are leading the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 each higher by over 1%. The proposed EU import tariff continues to hover at 50%, and July isn&#8217;t too far away, but for now, the markets are seeing the glass as half full. The Trump administration&#8217;s deal with the EU suggests further trade partner progress could be revealed sooner than later. Wall Street firm Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock ahead of the AI darling&#8217;s highly anticipated quarterly results due out tomorrow, advising investors to stay long on the stock and weather the uncertainty because the worst is behind them. Other Mag 7 stocks are higher today as well, including Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), each with a 1% jump. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is rallying 3.5% after Wedbush analysts labeled the EV maker an AI &#8220;pure play&#8221; and lifted the price target to $500 per share. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 378.17 (+0.89%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 275.40 (+1.5%) S&amp;P 500: Up 65.67 (+1.1%) Market Movers UBS has upgraded shares of LifeStance Health (Nasdaq: LFST) to a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on a bullish long-term outlook, sending the stock up 4%. Data analytics software stock Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is gaining 2% on the day in the tariff-fueled rally. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) will begin charging customers $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second later this week, a reversal of a longstanding &#8220;bags fly free&#8221; policy for the airline. The markets are rewarding LUV stock for the added revenue with a 3% advance.

NVDA,2025-05-28 12:10:40,S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) Live: Markets Upbeat on EU Tariff Surprise and Resilient Economy,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/sp-500-nysearca-spy-live-markets-upbeat-on-eu-20250528.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Wall Street Endorses Nuclear Stocks 12:10 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Goldman Sachs has issued a bullish report on a pair of nuclear stocks – Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) and NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) – pointing to regulatory tailwinds from the Trump administration. Both stocks have risen by double-digit percentages since President Trump issued an executive order last week. The president is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and shorten the wait for new reactor license approvals to one and a half years, a process that historically is known for moving at a snail&#8217;s pace. Business Orders Soften 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders posted a 6.3% decline last month, a softer drop than economists had predicted. However, this dip follows four consecutive months of increases, painting a mixed picture for business spending amid ongoing tariff discussions. A significant drag on the overall figures was Boeing (NYSE: BA), whose orders plunged 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Market sentiment has turned decidedly upbeat, with all three major stock market averages seeing gains from the open. President Trump agreed to delay proposed EU tariffs until July 9, which led to a 300-point jump for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also buoying stocks is the latest round of economic data. Consumer Confidence for May came in at a stronger than expected reading of 98, up 12.3 points month-over-month. Economists were calling for a reading of 86 in the face of tariffs. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is gaining 1.45% on the day. Technology stocks powering the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 up by over 1% each. Despite the pending 50% EU import tariff and July being right around the corner, markets are satisfied with the interim relief, viewing the Trump administration&#8217;s agreement with the EU as a potential precursor to further positive trade developments. Wall Street firm Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) ahead of the AI darling&#8217;s crucial quarterly results tomorrow. The firm suggests investors hold fast, believing the most challenging period is now behind the company. Other &#8220;Magnificent Seven&#8221; members are also enjoying gains, with Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) both up 1%. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stands out with a 3.5% rally after Wedbush analysts elevated the EV manufacturer to an AI &#8220;pure play&#8221; and boosted its price target to $500 per share. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 488.43 (+1.1%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 376.43 (+2.0%) S&amp;P 500: Up 90.11 (+1.5%) Market Movers UBS has upgraded LifeStance Health (Nasdaq: LFST) to a &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on a positive long-term forecast, sending the stock up 4%. Data analytics software specialist Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is also up 2% today, riding the broader tariff-driven rally. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) will soon begin charging customers $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, abandoning its signature &#8220;bags fly free&#8221; policy. This strategic move is being rewarded by investors, with LUV stock gaining 3%.

Despite a 1% dip year-to-date in the share price, Nvidia&#8217;s underlying fundamentals remain robust based on its most recent performance. The company has the potential to shift the focus from tariffs back to earnings, which have largely beaten expectations so far. Most Wall Street analysts maintain a buy rating on NVDA stock, projecting an average 12-month price target of $164, a considerable upside from current levels of $132. Nvidia&#8217;s upcoming Q1 report is expected to shed light on the impact of tariffs implemented in early 2025. This follows strong Q4 results where the company surpassed Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings. At the time, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, “AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.” NVDA stock is currently off fractionally while the SPX ETF is off by 0.37%. Tariff Tall Tale 12:24 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pushed back against President Donald Trump&#8217;s new tariff targeting Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhones, basically calling domestic production a tall tale. &#8220;We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the [U.S.] is a fairy tale that is not feasible,&#8221; Ives stated in a report. Trump threatened that Apple could face tariffs of 25% or more on iPhones made outside the USA. Apple recently revealed its intentions to redirect production of its iPhones from China to India. Apple stock is down 2.5% today, and the SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%. Fed Uncertainty 10:45 am by Gerelyn Terzo Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee cautioned Friday that President Donald Trump’s latest tariff moves have complicated monetary policy decisions and likely pushed back any interest rate changes. The Fed previously revealed its intentions to lower interest rates twice in 2025. Goolsbee told CNBC, &#8220;Everything’s always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while we’re waiting to get some clarity.&#8221; This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. A sharp sell-off gripped the markets this Friday morning, with all three major stock market averages surrendering ground. The week is set to conclude on a sour note, following President Trump’s recent threat to levy a steep 50% tariff on the EU, a measure that could be implemented in the coming days. In a potentially encouraging sign, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses almost in half, while both the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have similarly come off their worst levels. The majority of economic sectors are trading lower, with consumer discretionary and technology stocks taking the hardest hits. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.84%, while the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for a 2.7% weekly decline. Bond yields are declining as the trade war escalates, bringing a volatile week for the bond market to a close. Stock market volatility has also reemerged, highlighted by a 25% increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is facing renewed pressure, with President Trump warning that iPhones produced outside the U.S. could be subject to substantial tariffs, causing Apple stock to drop 2% today. Yet, in a bright spot among the Magnificent Seven, prominent Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is optimistic about Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), boosting his price target on the electric vehicle manufacturer to $500, suggesting a 49% upside potential, alongside an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 253.11 (-0.60%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 182.34 (-0.94%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.23 (-0.77%) Market Movers Nuclear stocks are defying the downward trend today, gaining ground as the Trump administration signals favorable conditions for the industry. Companies including Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), NuScale (NYSE: SMR), and Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) are all advancing, led by a double-digit percentage gain for OKLO. Quantum computing stock IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), however, is down as much as 4.7% today, following yesterday&#8217;s rally that saw its share price close above $45. In earnings developments, Intuit (NYSE: INTU) is gaining 8.6% today while Deckers (NYSE: DECK) is sinking 21.7% on a Wall Street downgrade following disappointing results on tariff impacts.

For bearish-leaning risk takers, the SPXS ETF offers powerful leverage when the S&amp;P 500 declines. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) The first quarter of this year reminded optimistic investors that stocks don&#8217;t only go up. Trade war tensions, recession worries, and other factors could spur a market crash in 2025. Instead of using fancy strategies like short-selling stocks or buying put options, there&#8217;s an easier way that doesn&#8217;t require a margin account. Bearish-leaning investors can profit from a stock market crash of 20% or more by owning inverse exchange traded funds (ETFs). These funds are specifically designed to gain value when a stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, goes down. There are risks involved, to be sure, but the following three inverse ETFs could set you up for powerful returns if the market craters. ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (SH) The S&amp;P 500 is a commonly cited stock index that represents a broad selection of large-cap U.S.-focused companies. Therefore, a simple way to profit from a stock market crash would be to hold an inverse ETF that gains value when the S&amp;P 500 collapses. ProShares offers an ETF that serves this exact purpose. It&#8217;s a fund called the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SH), and it seeks to move inversely to the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500. What&#8217;s good about moving inversely to the S&amp;P 500 is that it&#8217;s usually a slower-moving index than the NASDAQ 100. Therefore, the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF should carry less risk than some other inverse ETFs. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 comprises a broad range of stocks from multiple market sectors. Some S&amp;P 500 component stocks include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Thus, you&#8217;re actually achieving what I call &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the SH ETF. Even with the somewhat de-risking effect of &#8220;inverse diversification,&#8221; the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF could gain value quickly if there&#8217;s a stock market crash. Be aware, though, that the SH ETF won&#8217;t necessarily move up at the exact same pace that the S&amp;P 500 goes down. That&#8217;s because the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 throughout the day but then resets and rebalances the next day. As ProShares explains, &#8220;For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target [i.e., the S&amp;P 500]. These differences may be significant.&#8221; To put it another way, you&#8217;ll get faithful inverse S&amp;P 500 tracking for a day with the SH ETF. However, the longer you hold the fund, the more the results can vary from what you might expect. Consequently, while the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF would probably make you money during a market crash, it&#8217;s not meant to be held for too long. ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) If you&#8217;re willing to accept more risk, consider that the NASDAQ 100 mostly covers only one market sector (technology) and only includes around 100 stocks (as opposed to around 500 stocks in the more diversified S&amp;P 500). So, an ETF that inversely tracks the NASDAQ 100 is somewhat riskier but could yield greater rewards in the event of a market crash. To that end, you might consider the ProShares Short QQQ ETF (NYSEARCA:PSQ). This fund inversely corresponds to the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 index. Bear in mind that the NASDAQ 100 is mainly focused on technology sector stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). You won&#8217;t get as much &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the ProShares Short QQQ ETF as you would get with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, but you could potentially achieve greater returns during a market crash with the PSQ ETF. Much like with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, the ProShares Short QQQ ETF is subject to unexpected results if you hold the fund for longer than a day. Hence, I&#8217;ll send out a similar warning: even if the stock market is collapsing, don&#8217;t hold the PSQ ETF for too long because the risks will probably increase over time. Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (SPXS) My third entry for the best inverse ETFs to profit in a market crash is the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXS). This, like the SH ETF, may be somewhat de-risked because it inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 and has &#8220;inverse diversification.&#8221; However, the SPXS ETF is still the riskiest fund on this list. What makes the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF so high-risk and potentially high-reward is that the fund is inverse and triple-leveraged. This means that the SPXS ETF, on a daily basis, moves three times as fast as the S&amp;P 500, but in the opposite direction. In theory, you might assume that the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF would go up 60% if the S&amp;P 500 goes down 20%. Again, however, there&#8217;s no assurance of faithful index tracking beyond one day. Hence, you could get highly unexpected results if you hold the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF for a long time. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s probably too risky to hold the SPXS ETF for more than a couple of weeks, even during a stock market crash. Besides, if the stock market suddenly rallies, the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF could make a triple-magnified move to the downside. The point is that the SPXS ETF is for nimble, sniper-like traders who can get into and out of a position quickly.

Here’s a look at where things stand as of mid-morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 414.80 (-0.97%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 33.76 (-0.18%) S&amp;P 500: Down 31.69 (-0.53%) Market Movers It wasn&#8217;t just Target in the retail spotlight. TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX), known for discount brands like TJ Maxx, managed to beat Wall Street&#8217;s sales predictions but opted to maintain its existing full-year guidance. TJX appears to be capitalizing on current economic conditions as consumers become more cost-conscious and seek out value in branded goods. Nevertheless, TJX stock is losing 2.4% today. Elsewhere, Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) is off 6.9% today after releasing its third-quarter results. Despite the stock&#8217;s drop, Morningstar analysts are confident the company is successfully growing its market share. Super Micro Computer (Nasdaq: SMCI) is moving higher by 2.7%. The company is weighing an expansion in the U.S. Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE: FICO) has plummeted 11% today following scrutiny of its pricing model by a federal housing official, occurring in a week crucial for the housing industry with upcoming existing and new home sales data.

NVDA,2025-05-22 11:09:08,Snowflake (SNOW) 1st Quarter Earnings Live Coverage,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/snowflake-snow-1st-quarter-earnings-live-coverage-20250522.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Quick Recap 4:20 pm EPS (Non-GAAP): Not disclosed in the release — awaiting transcript or call.(The pre-release guidance implied ~$0.22–$0.23. Likely in line or modest beat) Product Revenue: $996.8M actual vs. $1.01B estimate → ~1.3% miss Total Revenue: $1.04B actual vs. $1.02–$1.03B consensus range → Slight beat Note: SNOW’s after-hours +5.6% move suggests Street was bracing for a softer print; RPO strength offset revenue miss. Up 5.6% After Hours — Execution Beat Clears the Bar, For Now 4:16 pm Snowflake shares rose 5.6% after hours following its Q1 print, signaling that the market was bracing for worse and found the steady revenue growth and robust RPO more than enough to offset deepening losses. While profitability remains a drag, the strong customer expansion and $6.7B in RPO validated the demand story — especially with enterprise software sentiment still fragile across the board. This price action suggests investors were more concerned about a usage slowdown or a reset in long-term guidance — neither of which materialized. The 606 million-dollar customers and continued momentum in AI narrative positioning helped reinforce Snowflake’s status as a durable platform name with optionality, even if monetization of next-gen features like Cortex and Snowpark is still emerging. That said, this reaction also likely reflects relief more than re-rating. For Snowflake to reclaim its high-multiple valuation and push beyond the $190–$200 zone, investors will eventually need more than just growth. Margin progress or explicit AI revenue metrics would be the likely fuel for a true breakout — but tonight, it’s clear the bar was set low enough for a beat to rally the stock. Snowflake Delivers $997M in Product Revenue but Posts Wider Loss 4:13 pm Snowflake’s fiscal Q1 2026 results came in largely aligned with investor expectations on the top line, but profitability remains a sticking point. Product revenue rose 26% year-over-year to $996.8 million, meeting guidance and extending the company’s streak of solid double-digit growth. Total revenue hit $1.04 billion, a new quarterly record. Remaining performance obligations grew 34% to $6.7 billion, suggesting healthy forward demand. Despite the top-line strength, Snowflake posted a GAAP net loss of $430 million, or $1.29 per share, a significantly wider loss than the same quarter last year. Operating expenses climbed over 25%, with sales and marketing costs topping $458 million and R&amp;D reaching $472 million. Adjusted free cash flow also shrank year-over-year to $206.3 million, reflecting heavier investment in operations and headcount amid platform expansion. The AI Data Cloud strategy was again front and center. Snowflake now serves 606 customers generating more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue, up 27% YoY. But profitability remains elusive as the company continues to prioritize infrastructure scale and product build-out over margin. Past earnings reactions 3:43 pm Snowflake has topped EPS estimates in three of the last four quarters, but price reactions have been muted — with the exception of the Q1 FY25 miss, which triggered a sharp selloff. The pattern is clear: beats don’t drive the stock unless accompanied by upside in usage metrics like RPO or product revenue. For tonight, merely hitting numbers may not be enough. Investors will be listening closely for evidence of traction in AI-native features and signs that larger enterprise customers are expanding usage across Snowflake’s platform. Quarter EPS Actual EPS Est. Surprise Stock Reaction Q4 FY25 $0.30 $0.17 +76% +4% Q3 FY25 $0.20 $0.15 +33% Flat Q2 FY25 $0.18 $0.16 +13% Flat/–1% Q1 FY25 $0.14 $0.18 –21% –12% Snowflake stock sentiment 3:32 pm Investor sentiment on Snowflake remains split. Institutional ownership remains high, but options activity ahead of earnings has leaned bullish, with elevated call volume near the $190 and $200 strikes. Despite the stock’s strong year-to-date performance, short interest is modest — under 3% of float — suggesting limited outright bearish conviction. However, many large funds have taken a wait-and-see stance following Snowflake’s stock-based comp controversy and uneven quarterly billings trends. Sell-side analysts are cautiously optimistic, with most ratings clustered in the Buy-to-Hold range and a median target around $203 — only modestly above current levels. Earnings-day volatility is typically elevated for SNOW, with options pricing implying a post-print move of ~7–9%. A strong RPO or AI monetization update could push shares through recent resistance, while muted platform usage data could invite a reset. AI Story Is Clear, Monetization Path Still Isn’t 2:37 pm On the last call, Snowflake executives leaned hard into the AI Data Cloud narrative. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy highlighted Cortex, Snowpark Container Services, and partnerships with Nvidia as cornerstones of Snowflake’s long-term roadmap. The company repeatedly emphasized that generative AI workloads would become a major source of data growth — and that Snowflake is positioned to be the “governed data layer” for those deployments. But investors came away with more vision than numbers. There was no quantification of AI’s contribution to RPO or ARR, and management offered little detail on attach rates for Snowpark or Cortex. Another focus was operational discipline. CFO Mike Scarpelli emphasized cost control and headcount restraint as drivers of recent EPS strength, while acknowledging that stock-based compensation remains elevated. With share-based comp still at over 40% of revenue, Snowflake’s narrative needs to transition from visionary to operationally credible. What to watch this quarter: Updated commentary on AI feature usage and client interest Any revenue disclosure tied to Cortex or Snowpark Signals on NRR or multi-product adoption Tone shift from visionary to accountable execution Keys to watch 1:28 pm In recent quarters, Snowflake has delivered impressive headline beats but raised concerns under the surface — particularly around deal timing and monetization of new AI products. While Q4 FY25 posted a strong $0.30 EPS vs. $0.17 estimate, much of the beat was driven by expense control rather than accelerating usage. The company has emphasized its AI Data Cloud vision and the rollout of Snowflake Cortex — a generative AI suite embedded in the platform — but has not disclosed revenue contribution from these new services. Analysts will be pressing for any update on attach rates or NRR improvements tied to AI features. Another key trend is stock-based compensation. SBC accounted for 41% of revenue last year, drawing scrutiny from institutional investors. Any moderation here — especially as revenue scales — could boost confidence in the path to GAAP profitability. Watch for: RPO growth (billings proxy) AI-related platform adoption commentary SBC as % of revenue New customer count and expansion rates Data Cloud Macro Tailwinds Must Now Show Up in Usage and Margins 12:27 pm Snowflake operates in a sweet spot of enterprise software — a data infrastructure layer increasingly central to AI deployment. But that macro opportunity has yet to fully translate into breakout earnings power. With usage-based revenue still sensitive to customer optimization cycles, investors are looking for signals that the stabilization seen across AWS and Azure is flowing into Snowflake’s billings and RPO. Last quarter’s beat was strong on paper — $0.30 EPS vs. $0.17 expected — but was driven more by cost control than visible AI monetization. This quarter, investors will be looking closely at product revenue growth, RPO trajectory, and any signs that Snowflake’s newer features like Cortex AI and Snowpark Containers are seeing measurable traction. The AI Data Cloud story is compelling, but to move the stock higher, Snowflake must prove it is winning real workloads and expanding usage — not just demoing new features. Gross margin and customer count detail will be key earnings call focal points. Snowflake (NASDAQ: SNOW) heads into its earnings report after the market closes today with investors watching closely for signs of margin discipline and execution in enterprise AI workloads. Shares are up more than 20% year to date, fueled by bullish sentiment around Snowflake’s positioning in the data infrastructure layer of the modern tech stack. But after a sharp miss one year ago and only modest improvements to operating leverage, the company still needs to prove it can convert product excitement into scalable, profitable growth. The Street expects first-quarter revenue of $1.01 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.21 — representing year-over-year growth of 21% and 51%, respectively. Those headline numbers are strong, but they come with an asterisk: Snowflake’s usage-based pricing model has led to uneven quarter-to-quarter trends, and many analysts are now more focused on remaining performance obligations (RPO) and net revenue retention (NRR) than simple top-line beats. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, who took over earlier this year, has emphasized streamlining the product suite and embedding generative AI tools into core workflows. The company’s “AI Data Cloud” narrative has gained traction with analysts, but actual monetization from new products like Cortex and Snowpark remains difficult to quantify. Investors are also watching for improvements in profitability. Last fiscal year, stock-based compensation accounted for over 40% of revenue — a figure that’s drawn increasing scrutiny from both institutional holders and sell-side coverage. With FY26 full-year EPS forecast at just $1.16 and GAAP profitability still elusive, this quarter needs to show more than just robust customer activity. Snowflake has a narrative tailwind — but to keep the stock’s valuation intact, it has to start delivering earnings momentum to match.

NVDA,2025-05-19 10:00:04,Michael Burry Predicted The Housing Market Crash and Just Sold His Portfolio and Shorted The Market Again,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/michael-burry-predicted-the-housing-market-crash-and-just-20250519.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Michael Burry is a hedge fund manager renowned for founding Scion Capital and predicting the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. His foresight, detailed in Michael Lewis’s The Big Short, which was made into an Oscar-winning film, earned him $100 million personally and $700 million for investors by shorting mortgage-backed securities. Burry’s contrarian approach, rooted in meticulous research and value investing inspired by Benjamin Graham, also sparked the GameStop (NYSE:GME) meme stock frenzy in 2021 through early investments. Known for spotting market bubbles, he has warned of risks in passive investing and inflation. His renamed Scion Asset Management hedge fund just filed its latest quarterly report, and Burry made headlines again because he sold 12 of the 13 stocks in his $77.4 million portfolio, including stakes in Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH). More to the point, Burry is once again aggressively shorting the market. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Michael Burry runs the Scion Asset Management hedge fund who gained fame for shorting the housing market during the subprime mortgage debacle in 2008. Burry made a number of big bets on Chinese tech stocks that he started turning bearish on late last year. In Scion&#8217;s latest SEC filing, it showed Burry went extremely negative by selling off virtually all of his stocks and buying put options on many of them. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. Going Negative Burry&#8217;s portfolio is typically fairly concentrated. Where many hedge funds hold dozens, if not hundreds of stocks, Scion Asset held just a baker&#8217;s dozen. In addition to Alibaba and Molina, Burry also owned several large positions in Chinese stocks, including e-commerce site JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), search engine giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), the owner of online shopping platforms Temu and Pinduoduo. The sale of these companies suggests Burry had become more bearish, but not necessarily on the U.S. market. Rather, it is on China&#8217;s economy that his outlook became more pessimistic. He actually began selling down most of his Chinese holdings late last year, but he didn&#8217;t move to a cash position. Instead, he began betting heavily against them by buying put options on the stocks, also betting Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM), a Chinese online travel agent, would go down as well. A Bet Against Tech There was one U.S. company that Burry went negative on as well: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). In fact, the put options he holds on the artificial intelligence chipmaker are the largest position in Scion&#8217;s portfolio now, valued at over $97.5 million and accounting for 49% of the portfolio. Alibaba is the next closest position with a $26.4 million value, or 13% of the total. A put option is a financial contract giving the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset (in this case, the stock) at a specified price called the strike price before or on a set expiration date. Investors use puts to hedge against price declines or speculate on falling markets. If the asset’s price drops below the strike price, the buyer can sell at the higher strike, profiting from the difference. If the price rises, the buyer may let the option expire, losing only the premium paid. Puts are key tools for managing risk or betting on bearish trends. Delayed Reaction Because 13F-HR filings &#8212; the equivalent of a quarterly report for institutional investment managers &#8212; are looking in the rearview mirror, they only tell us what happened in the past. In Scion Asset Management&#8217;s case, it reflects its first quarter activity. All of these trades could have occurred in early January, and despite only just filing the report, Burry&#8217;s portfolio could look markedly different today. For example, Alibaba&#8217;s stock tumbled sharply in March and early April, before bouncing higher again. BABA stock is up 47% so far in 2025. Both JD.com and Baidu followed a similar pattern, though not to the same degree. JD stock is down 3% year-to-date while BIDU is up 6%. Although the Chinese stocks rallied early in the year due to the DeepSeek AI breakthrough development, its purported low-cost challenge to large language models caused Nvidia to plunge. Nvidia suffered the steepest decline, falling as low as $86 a share, or 30% below where it started the year, before rebounding. It is essentially flat in 2025, having surged 55% from its low point. Burry may have sold all of his put options on these stocks when their prices were below the strike price. Key Takeaway It&#8217;s interesting that Burry sold all the stocks in his portfolio, except one. The hedge fund operator held onto his position in cosmetics giant Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL), and actually doubled his stake in its stock, buying another 100,000 shares for a total value of $13.2 million. Yet Burry bet so heavily against the Chinese stocks that EL now represents less than 7% of Scion Asset Management&#8217;s holdings, whereas before it represented nearly 10%. This is not the same as Burry&#8217;s Big Short bet 17 years ago that brought him fame and fortune, but his moves last quarter were notable because of their obvious negative implications for China.

Nearly $3 trillion of investment commitments in AI have been announced, which span a period of years. Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple are major players, along with the UAE, Open AI, and Softbank.Risk is present from China producing less expensive or more powerful chips, or imposing trade restrictions that could greatly impact our tech companies. However, the US is striving to be the dominant world leader of AI, for which It does not take a genius to consider long term holds for Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple. In the last 5 weeks NVIDIA has risen 23.6%, up from a low of 94, to 116. However, that is well under their 2025 highpoint of 149. Similarly, the 2025 high of Oracle was 186, but currently is 150, while Apple has dropped 61 points since the day after Christmas, and is now 198, down 23.5%. Although we may see some significant volatility with trade negotiations in the short term, for the coming years, I would expect the large domestic investments made by these key tech companies to produce excellent returns. Also, Taiwan Semiconductors is investing $100 billion for producing their chips here, and that stock is down over 21% in the last 2 ½ months. Likely this would also be a very good hold.What do AI data centers need? Electricity! By 2030, AI data centers are estimated to require 9% of total electricity usage in the United States, with overall demand for electricity projected to increase by 16%. AI data centers are planned for Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, North Carolina, and other areas, for which one might look at providers of electricity in those states. Oncor, that is owned by Sempra, is a major servicer of Texas. The parent company is one of the largest utility holding companies in the US, with current pricing of $75 per share, which is down from $87 in early January, and is paying a dividend of 3.4%. American Electric Power (AEP) is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, for which that stock is up almost 14% this year, and paying a current dividend yield of 3.54%. AEP exceeded analyst expectations of earnings per share by 8.1%, while Ohio is experiencing growth with favorable tax legislation. Several AI data centers are planned for south Florida, while Florida has experienced tremendous population growth, gaining nearly 2 million more residents since 2019. When speaking of electricity to power Florida, one might consider investments in Nexterra, that owns Florida Power and Light, the largest utility in the state, and has a dividend yield of 3.22%. I also am an advocate for Duke Energy, which is held by numerous pension funds. Duke is one of the three great universities of Research Triangle Park, along with the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State. This area of the country has one of the highest concentrations of PhD’s, for which Apple and others are investing in data centers in North Carolina. Duke Energy is up about 12% in 2025, which is excellent for a bit over 4 months, and has a dividend yield of 3.47%.An additional component for not only the construction of AI data centers, but for the expansion of many industries that will benefit from the huge investments being made in the US, is&#8230; infrastructure! This leads one to ETFs for materials. One might take a look at XLB, Vanguard Materials (VAW), and Invesco (PYZ).What is driving both foreign and domestic investment in the US, is the likely legislation of tax cuts, combined with no tariffs for producing goods in the United States. This is a one-two punch for an economic stimulus, along with 18 trade deals being in the stages of final negotiation, which hopefully will dramatically increase US production and exports.This is the first in a series of articles to capitalize on the trillions of dollars of investment commitments that have been announced in recent weeks, along with a multitude of trade deals and tax cut legislation that should be forthcoming. The phrase that comes to mind is that the best time is… NOW!I encourage the reader to do their own research, and to consult with a competent investment advisor.

AMD Up 5% in Mid-Day Trading 1:07 pm by Joel South Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is up 5.3% shortly after 1 p.m. ET. AI stocks across the board are seeing market-beating gains today. NVIDIA is up 3.7% while infrastructure stocks like Vertiv are also seeing gains. Still, AMD&#8217;s gain is higher than most stocks thanks to the announcement of its deal with Humain as well as its $6 billion share buyback. Looking to the back half of 2025, whether or not AMD can outperform the market largely depends on whether it can continue making inroads as companies continue spending more on inferencing, and also whether it can diversify its customer base. The deals announced this week with Saudi Arabia have led to significant gains for AI stocks because they demonstrate a path to AI companies reducing their reliance on hyperscalers for revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Just Announced a $6 Billion Buyback 10:09 am At the moment, Advanced Micro Devices is up 5.7%, or by $6.50 to $118.86. From here, we’d like to see the tech giant test $125 initially. Fueling upside, the trade war with China is finally cooling. Second, the company just partnered with Saudi Arabia’s AI company, Humain, in a $10 billion deal. AMD also just announced a $6 billion stock buyback program. As noted by Yahoo Finance, “Shares of the chip company jumped nearly 7% on the news that the board has approved that $6 billion share repurchase plan. Represents about 3.3% of the company&#8217;s current market value, according to data from Bloomberg. The new authorization in addition to the remaining balance from their last authorization of about $4 billion. What that means, the total current repurchase authorization of about $10 billion.” The Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock is set to open even higher when markets open today. At the moment, shares of AMD are up about 3.3%, or $3.74. That’s because of two key catalysts. First, the trade war with China is finally cooling, at least for the next 90 days. That should remove a good deal of uncertainty from tech stocks, like AMD. Second, the company just partnered with Saudi Arabia’s AI company, Humain, in a $10 billion deal. As noted by Wedbush, “We believe the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names in our view”. Analysts are Calling for AMD to Challenge $200 Analysts at DZ Bank just reiterated a buy rating on AMD with a $200 price target. All thanks to blowout earnings. EPS of 96 cents beat by three cents. Revenue of $7.44 billion, up 36% year over, beat estimates by $320 million. Data Center revenue jumped 57% year-over-year to $3.7 billion thanks to its MI300 AI accelerator and its Instinct and EPYC processors. Revenue from the Client and Gaming segment, which houses AMD&#8217;s PC business, was up 28% year-over-year to $2.8 billion. Client revenue was $2.3B, up 68% year-over-year, while gaming revenue tumbled 30% year-over-year to $647 million. Analysts expected EPS of 94 cents on revenues of $7.12 billion. Analysts at Bank of America just raised its price target by $10 to $130 a share. All thanks to AMD’s latest deal with Saudi Arabia. “Bank of America predicts these projects to cost between $3 billion to $5 billion annually, which equates to a range of $15 billion to $20 billion across multiple years”.

NVDA,2025-05-13 08:00:04,China’s Super AI Chip Steps Up,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/chinas-super-ai-chip-steps-up-20250513.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points Huawei is reportedly producing AI chips that rival NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) in performance but at lower cost, posing a serious threat to NVIDIA’s international business. The potential shift toward less power-intensive Chinese chips could reduce data center electricity costs, an increasingly critical factor as AI workloads grow. U.S. grid limitations and surging power demands—particularly from AI and data centers—point to structural energy constraints that could affect the viability of NVIDIA&#8217;s growth assumptions. With the markets whipsawing on volatility, tariffs and trade deals now is the best time to meet with a financial advisor to see if you’re on track, or behind with your retirement plans.

Watch the Video https://videos.247wallst.com/247wallst.com/2025/05/13Chinas-Super-AI-Chip-Steps-Up.mp4 Transcript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: So Lee, this is sort of the dynamics right now of the, what I would call the super AI chips. [00:00:09] Doug McIntyre: You&#8217;ve obviously gotten NVIDIA. NVIDIA has now said that the, uh, AI in China is as good as it is in the United States. So that means that China&#8217;s less expensive chips work. You, you, you, you don&#8217;t need the highest end NVIDIA chips to create great I AI products. And you do have a couple of very good AI chip companies, uh, in China. [00:00:39] Doug McIntyre: Which one do, who do you like? Who do you like? [00:00:42] Doug McIntyre: Well, [00:00:42] Lee Jackson: I mean, clearly the chatter you hear outta China is that Huawei, you know, who is, who is not one of our favorite vendors over here, um, is got a chip that&#8217;s gonna compete straight up with it. And you gotta believe that it won&#8217;t be near the premium price that then NVIDIA chips are going for. [00:01:02] Lee Jackson: And if they come up with that NVIDIA could really face some, some serious trouble. [00:01:08] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Uh, keep, keep going. I&#8217;m just going over to look at NVIDIA&#8217;s price today. So, well, [00:01:14] Lee Jackson: you know. It, it is interesting. E every time the, you know, you can tell that there&#8217;s been huge algorithmic trading, buying and selling, uh, of NVIDIA because anytime there&#8217;s negative futures, you know, NVIDIA and the QQs trade down and that anytime things are positive, it trades back up. [00:01:34] Lee Jackson: I mean, NVIDIA got down to, what, 95, 90? It&#8217;s now back over 110, whatever. [00:01:42] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Yes. [00:01:43] Lee Jackson: This, this would be a total kill shot to the huge growth that NVIDIA has shown over the last five years, seven years, that it would be really, really bad. And Huawei has the, the wherewithal and obviously they&#8217;ve got the ear of the communist Chinese government to keep producing and to put out items that are helpful for their internal economy. [00:02:09] Lee Jackson: So, yeah, I mean, I think that could be big, really big. [00:02:13] Doug McIntyre: Well look, they&#8217;re down. NVIDIA&#8217;s down. Depends on the day between 15 and 20%. Depends on one of those days when the and NA is way up or its way down. Right. But here&#8217;s the problem. Chinese chips are not gonna get sold in the United States. There&#8217;s too much paranoia on the part of the government that never used to steal intellectual property or the phone numbers of people&#8217;s girlfriends or something. [00:02:40] Doug McIntyre: But what it does mean is, is that NVIDIA&#8217;s customer base outside the United States in many cases, are gonna start to look at these chips as less expensive. Oh, absolutely. To NVIDIA. There&#8217;s another part of this that people haven&#8217;t looked at. Less powerful, less expensive chips tend to eat up less electricity. [00:03:05] Doug McIntyre: Yep. So if you, if you believe that Chinese AI is very, very good and you&#8217;re willing to default to that as the product you&#8217;re gonna use, it may be that your AI data centers do not need to suck up as much electricity, which means you don&#8217;t have to pay as much for electricity, which means the cost of goods sold in that business tends it gets a little bit better. [00:03:31] Lee Jackson: Yeah. It really is, as we&#8217;ve discussed in in other times, that the concerns on the electrical grid are huge because obviously we&#8217;ve never really done anything to upgrade our grids. They always do it, you know, when they have to, oh, we better fix this. Why didn&#8217;t you fix it before? [00:03:53] Lee Jackson: Well, we didn&#8217;t have the money, we didn&#8217;t have this or that. But yeah, if, if you could have a chip that, that runs and charge, uses less electricity, that would be huge. [00:04:05] Doug McIntyre: Well look, Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google now called Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), I think it was called Google when he was there, said that he believes about five years out that 99% of the electricity produced in the United States will go towards AI server farms and AI software function. [00:04:26] Doug McIntyre: So, I mean, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say he&#8217;s off by a factor of two and it&#8217;s only 50%. We&#8217;re now talking about whether or not you, we can get these high-end chips to use less electricity because at that point, computational power and energy use are going to become much more equivalent to one another. [00:04:50] Doug McIntyre: Electricity use is just starting to get to be a problem. Computational power is what&#8217;s on the. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s on the table as what&#8217;s critical. [00:04:59] Lee Jackson: Yeah. And the big utility companies are, are trying to anticipate this as well. You&#8217;re right. [00:05:05] Doug McIntyre: Yeah, but they can&#8217;t look, if you wanted to rebuild the infrastructure in Texas, let&#8217;s just take the electricity infrastructure in Texas, you&#8217;d have to have a hundred billion, you&#8217;d have to have tens and tens and tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild the grid there. [00:05:23] Doug McIntyre: That&#8217;s one state. Okay. The other problem is, is that you still gotta figure out where to find the energy. Let&#8217;s say the grid&#8217;s perfect. It&#8217;s perfect. Donald Trump has decided to basically shoot wind in the head. Solar is fine. It&#8217;s doing pretty well, but not enough. Those small nuclear reactors we keep talking about, which costs much less, uh, money to make are easier to deploy. [00:05:51] Doug McIntyre: Right. Those are not tested. Okay. So they&#8217;ve gotta be taken out of alpha through beta to the point where everybody knows they work and then regulatory commission or somebody else has to get to the point where they bless &#8217;em. So nuclear is great, but we&#8217;re not there yet. Nope. Elect The growth in electricity capacity is not anywhere near what people think it could be. [00:06:17] Doug McIntyre: There are too many components in there that have to do with slow growing or not growing renewables. And look, it&#8217;s gonna be coal you. If you want a fast growing electricity generation in the United States, while you improve the grid, your only option is to move back to some amount of coal. [00:06:41] Lee Jackson: I don&#8217;t disagree. [00:06:42] Lee Jackson: And we&#8217;ve got tons of it in West Virginia and in the, that part of the United States, we have tons of it. And the thing is, you know, there will be somebody someday that finally. Finds a way to, and they use methane gas from, from landfills and they&#8217;re gonna have to start checking all that stuff out again. [00:07:01] Lee Jackson: Can you burn garbage and, and, and generate energy via that? They&#8217;re gonna try to have to go back to that because, it&#8217;ll take, what, 10 years for the small nuclears to get, to get up and running and in the grid at least. Yep. I think so. And, and the problem we&#8217;re gonna have is we&#8217;re gonna, there&#8217;s already in California and, and other parts of the country, there&#8217;s already rolling brownouts periodically just because there&#8217;s not enough, especially if, if renewables aren&#8217;t, aren&#8217;t contributing, uh, the percentage that that takes to keep the grid running perfectly and we wasted maybe four years where we put too much emphasis on green appliances and stuff like that. And now you&#8217;re gonna have to just focus on generating power.

When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.

FCF is +321% Net Income is +345% This is a monster pic.twitter.com/wMWgEewFkJ — The Long Investor (@TheLongInvest) May 5, 2025 Earnings are out 4:15 pm by Joel South Hims &amp; Hers reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2025, with revenue rising 111% year-over-year to $586.0 million. Net income for the quarter was $49.5 million, up from $11.1 million in Q1 2024. The company posted adjusted EBITDA of $91.1 million, compared to $32.3 million a year ago, bringing adjusted EBITDA margin to 16%. The company’s subscriber base grew to 2.4 million, reflecting 38% growth from the prior year. Monthly online revenue per average subscriber increased 53% to $84, indicating higher per-user monetization. Gross margin came in at 73%, down from 82% in the prior year period, which the company attributes to product mix changes and scaling of new fulfillment capabilities. Following the FDA&#8217;s decision to end the semaglutide shortage, Hims transitioned away from compounded GLP-1 prescriptions and began offering branded alternatives through a new partnership with Novo Nordisk. Despite the shift, revenue and subscriber growth remained strong in Q1, with leadership citing continued adoption across weight loss and other care categories. The company maintained its full-year revenue guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion and raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $295 million to $335 million. Additionally, management introduced new long-term targets for 2030, aiming for at least $6.5 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Hims will host a conference call later today to discuss the results in more detail, including performance drivers across its growing portfolio of care categories and operational updates related to its pharmacy and logistics network. HIMS Earnings: 3 Things to Watch 2:44 pm by Joel South GLP-1 Transition Under ScrutinyHims&#8217; shift from compounded to branded GLP-1s will test growth durability, margin structure, and fulfillment capacity — all eyes are on early uptake and unit economics. Subscriber Momentum Must HoldStrong 2024 subscriber growth now faces a regulatory test; Q1 must confirm continued expansion and multi-vertical engagement to validate the platform&#8217;s scalability. Margins Reflect Operational DisciplineAnalysts expect stable 6–8% EBITDA margins; any deviation could signal pressure from branded drug costs or fulfillment inefficiencies as Hims expands care categories. HIMS Names Former Amazon Executive as COO 2:22 pm by Joel South Hims has appointed Nader Kabbani as its new Chief Operating Officer, marking a significant leadership addition as the telehealth company expands its personalized care offerings. Kabbani brings nearly two decades of experience from Amazon, where he led initiatives including the acquisition of PillPack, the launch of Amazon Pharmacy, and the development of Amazon Logistics and Kindle. He also oversaw Amazon’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts for over a million individuals. CEO Andrew Dudum emphasized Kabbani’s role in scaling global operations to deliver affordable, seamless healthcare. The appointment coincides with Hims &amp; Hers&#8217; recent partnership with Novo Nordisk to offer the FDA-approved weight-loss drug Wegovy through its platform, enhancing access to obesity care. Following these developments, HIMS stock rose over 3% to $42.19, reflecting investor confidence in the company&#8217;s strategic direction. HIMS earnings keys: guidance and margins 2:00 pm by Joel South Hims &amp; Hers has guided for FY25 revenue between $1.17 billion and $1.19 billion, representing a healthy increase over FY24’s $872 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to land between $70 million and $80 million, implying sustained EBITDA margins above 6%. These targets reflect a careful balance between growth and profitability as the company moves into new, more regulated care categories. On the Q4 2024 earnings call, CFO Yemi Okupe emphasized the company’s intention to drive profitability without compromising growth, pointing to the success of its vertically integrated model and data-driven customer acquisition engine. Management also highlighted efforts to improve marketing efficiency and maintain strong retention through service layering. The guidance includes expectations around the full rollout of branded GLP-1 medications following the discontinuation of compounded options. The shift is likely to influence both gross margins and per-customer profitability, making this quarter’s commentary on cost structure especially relevant to modelers. Analysts will be looking for any updates to this outlook, especially if the adoption curve for Wegovy is ahead of expectations or if churn increases materially. Margin stability in Q1 could reinforce confidence in the scalability of the platform, particularly as Hims expands into higher-acuity care and medication fulfillment partnerships. HIMS sentiment heading into earnings release 1:33 pm by Joel South Investor sentiment around Hims &amp; Hers heading into Q1 earnings is cautiously constructive. While the discontinuation of compounded GLP-1 prescriptions introduced a level of uncertainty, analysts have broadly applauded the company’s rapid strategic response. The April announcement of a partnership with Novo Nordisk to offer Wegovy, an FDA-approved GLP-1 treatment, helped alleviate fears of demand disruption and was viewed as a critical step in maintaining user continuity. Sell-side coverage remains largely bullish, with price targets consolidating in the mid-$20s. Several firms — including Jefferies and Bank of America — have reiterated their positive outlooks, citing Hims’ resilient subscriber growth and potential upside from new care verticals. That said, consensus does reflect a more tempered stance compared to late 2024, when sentiment was euphoric around GLP-1 traction. Key themes in recent analyst notes include scrutiny over fulfillment cost structures for branded medications, margin implications from co-branded logistics, and whether churn rates might tick up in Q1. While no major downgrades have surfaced, several firms have flagged the need for greater transparency around economics per subscriber and cost-per-acquisition as the company scales. Ultimately, today’s earnings report will serve as a barometer of investor confidence in Hims’ ability to absorb regulatory shocks and maintain momentum. Sentiment remains optimistic — but Q1 results could either validate or reset expectations for FY25 growth. HIMS subscriber growth and past stock performance 12:52 pm by Joel South Throughout 2024, Hims &amp; Hers demonstrated consistent top-line acceleration driven by new product introductions and broader consumer adoption. The company’s revenue grew from $260 million in Q1 2024 to $481 million in Q4, with subscriber growth moving in tandem — increasing from 1.5 million to 2.2 million across the same period. This momentum reflects strong execution across multiple verticals, especially in mental health and metabolic care. In particular, the launch of GLP-1 weight-loss services mid-2024 significantly bolstered engagement, although much of that volume came through compounded versions prior to the recent FDA decision. With branded access now in place, investors are keen to see if the company can preserve that growth trajectory in Q1 2025. Comparing past quarters also reveals positive trends in average order value and retention. CFO Yemi Okupe previously pointed to increasing multi-category engagement as a margin lever — users who start with one vertical, such as mental health, often expand into dermatology or primary care. As today&#8217;s results arrive, the question is whether these patterns have continued into 2025, or if the post-compounding GLP-1 adjustment is creating temporary friction in subscriber additions. Forward commentary on churn, conversion, and re-engagement will be vital to contextualizing Q1 results. Wall Street&#039;s expectations for tonights earnings 11:25 am by Joel South According to Capital IQ, the Street expects Q1 2025 revenue of $260.91 million, representing 57% year-over-year growth. EPS is projected at $0.03, consistent with the company’s recent trend of balancing top-line growth with margin expansion. Analysts have remained relatively steady in their forecasts over the past 60 days, signaling confidence in the company’s ability to execute through volatility. Notably, some models may not fully account for the rapid GLP-1 shift from compounded to branded fulfillment. Thus, revenue composition and subscriber dynamics will be closely scrutinized in the release. In terms of profitability, consensus EBITDA margins are expected to come in around 6%–8%, roughly in line with FY24 results. The company previously guided for FY25 revenue between $1.17B and $1.19B, with EBITDA between $70M and $80M — targets that could be revised depending on Q1 performance and adoption trends of new product categories. Watching for GLP-1 Fallout 10:14 am by Joel South The telehealth platform was hit earlier this year by the Food &amp; Drug Administration declaring there was no longer a shortage of Ozempic or Wegovy, the GLP-1 drugs sold by Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) for the treatment of of diabetes and obesity, respectively. Because Hims was able to sell compounded versions of the treatments, the FDA announcement crushed HIMS stock, cutting the stock nearly in half. It subsequently loss some 68% of its value, despite promising to sell personalized dosages of semaglutide. That&#8217;s a bit of an end-run around the regulations, as the generic versions of the branded drug can continue to be sold so long as they are personalized beyond the standard dosages commercially available. More than just weight-loss Yet GLP-1 drugs represented less than 20% of Hims &amp; Hers revenue in 2024 while hair-loss products for both men and women enjoyed phenomenal growth. In Q4, Hims Derm saw 55% year-over-year subscriber growth while Hers Derm more than doubled. Hims provides generic Rogaine and Propecia. Other major contributors to HIMS 69% revenue growth in 2024 include sexual health treatments, such as drugs for erectile dysfunction, such as generic Viagra, and mental health services and treatments, including generic Zoloft. And just last week, Hims &amp; Hers and Novo Nordisk announced an agreement for the telehealth platform to sell branded Wegovy on its site for $599 per month. This is a significant opportunity because it derisks the potential for litigation from the Dutch pharmaceutical while bringing in a well-known brand. It also means Hims will likely stop selling its cheaper compounded versions as it transitions subscribers to the branded drug. Hurdles still to get over However, Wegovy has lost significant market share to rival Eli Lilly&#8216;s (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound, because it is seen as a better, more efficacious GLP-1 drug. Zepbound&#8217;s active ingredient, tirzepetide, is known as a dual-agonist as it targets the GLP-1 receptors as well as the receptors. Semaglutide only targets the GLP-1 receptor. Lilly also recently reported positive late-stage clinical trial results for its oral weight-loss treatment orforglipron. It expects to gain FDA approval to market it later this year and is already stockpiling the drug so there are no shortages. These developments mean Hims &amp; Hers may enjoy less traction in sales than many envision as suggested by HIMS 45% bounce in the stock last week. HIMS stock is up 2% at $41.64 per share ahead of the market&#8217;s open. What to watch after the market closes 9:24 am by Joel South Shares of Hims &amp; Hers Health have rallied 250% over the past year, buoyed by growing adoption of its direct-to-consumer model and continued expansion into new care categories. The company’s focus on retaining customers and driving lifetime value through vertical integration has enabled strong gross margins and operating leverage. Today, investors are watching closely to see how the company weathers regulatory headwinds in the weight-loss market. In early 2025, the FDA declared the semaglutide shortage over, ending a period during which compounded GLP-1 prescriptions helped fuel subscriber growth. That decision forced Hims to discontinue those compounded offerings, but the company moved swiftly — launching a partnership with Novo Nordisk to provide access to branded Wegovy through its platform. This pivot has helped stabilize investor sentiment, but the impact on margins and customer acquisition remains unclear. Bulls argue that branded partnerships provide more durable growth; skeptics question the long-term pricing structure and whether the company can retain users amid evolving fulfillment models. Heading into earnings, there is high expectations for continued subscriber growth, and we will be focused on that number when earnings are out. Hims &amp; Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) will report its Q1 2025 financial results today, after the market closes with a conference call shortly after at 5 pm (which we will have live coverage on). Analysts expect the company to post revenue of $260.91 million and earnings per share of $0.03, according to Capital IQ. For a company that began as a startup tackling stigma in men’s health, today marks another milestone in its transformation into a scaled, consumer-driven healthcare platform. From its origins in telehealth prescriptions for hair loss and ED, Hims has evolved into a fast-moving digital health brand offering treatment for mental health, dermatology, and weight loss. Co-Founder and CEO Andrew Dudum has described 2024 as a “validation year” for the company — not just in terms of product traction, but in demonstrating that its vertically integrated model can scale efficiently. That model, which keeps pharmacy operations, clinical services, and marketing in-house, is central to Hims&#8217; claim of being able to innovate faster and deliver care more affordably. The company ended last year with 2.2 million subscribers, a 45% increase from the prior year, while generating positive free cash flow and EBITDA margins of 6.2%. CFO Yemi Okupe attributed the company’s growing leverage to disciplined acquisition spend and increased average order values as users engage across multiple care categories. Now, Q1 will test whether that momentum continues. The GLP-1 program, which launched in 2024, is expected to play a major role in revenue acceleration this year. Dudum said it will be a &#8220;meaningful contributor&#8221; to top-line growth in 2025, and investors will be watching closely for early signals on fulfillment scale and prescription uptake. Also in focus are the company’s newer verticals in dermatology and cardiovascular health, which are still early-stage but central to Hims’ long-term vision. Analysts are eager to see if those categories are beginning to gain traction. Stay tuned for rolling updates throughout the day as we break down expectations for tonight&#8217;s earnings and what we are most interesting in seeing from HIMS 1st quarter results.

(NASDAQ: NVDA) proxy (PRE 14A). That is up $1 million from the year before. That pay was so low because most of his compensation comes from stock awards and “nonincentive compensation,” which can vary. In other words, the $1.5 million was all he could count on. It was his first base salary increase in a decade. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Last year, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) Jensen Huang had his first base salary increase in a decade. Low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Huang has a net worth of $98 billion, which makes him the 17th richest person in the world. Nvidia’s stock is down this year, so that figure has dropped $16 billion since January 1. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. The stock has dropped 17% so far this year. Most of Huang’s compensation for the recently reported year came from a stock award of $38 million. The problem with that award is that, if Nvidia’s stock drops, that sum could go down as well. Huang owns 3.5% of the company he founded in 1993. He turned it from a graphic chip company into the largest artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world. Huang’s low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Warren Buffett’s cash compensation last year was only $100,000. Because of his ownership in Berkshire Hathaway, his net worth is $166 billion, which makes him the sixth richest person in the world. From 1997 to 2011 when Steve Jobs retired as Apple’s CEO, his base cash compensation was only $1. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO today, had a base cash salary of $3 million last year. The low base salaries of highly successful CEOs are hard to explain. Do they tell investors that their pay is tied almost completely to performance? Or are they saying that to their employees? Huang and his board did not say.
