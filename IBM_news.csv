Initial expenses encompass acquiring licenses, tailoring the system to meet particular organizational requirements, educating personnel, and assimilating with current IT infrastructures. Ongoing expenses are incurred due to continuous maintenance, system upgrades, and licensing for the license management software. For SMEs and cost-sensitive businesses, these financial obligations frequently surpass the anticipated advantages, hindering market adoption and promoting manual or hybrid tracking methodologies. Complex and Diverse Licensing Models Across Vendors: Vendors currently provide more complex licensing structures, including per-seat, per-core, concurrent user, metered usage, and subscription models. Managing licenses is greatly complicated by the intricate web of diverse contractual terms and compliance standards. Organizations must consistently oversee modifications to vendor contracts and adapt their tracking accordingly. The absence of standardization among software suppliers elevates administrative expenses and subjects firms to unintentional non-compliance risks, hence diminishing the efficiency benefits of automation solutions. Integration Challenges with Existing IT Infrastructure: For numerous companies, particularly those utilizing legacy or hybrid cloud systems, the integration of a contemporary license management platform is complex. Disparate data silos, bespoke apps, and obsolete ERP systems frequently impede seamless integration.

Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) provides strong cryptographic security and audit capabilities, minimizing fraud and illegal access. Entities within the BFSI, legal, and healthcare sectors are implementing BaaS to enhance verification procedures, mitigate operational risks, and bolster trust among stakeholders. Increasing Adoption in Supply Chain and Logistics: Blockchain facilitates real-time asset monitoring, provenance verification, and immutable recording—essential requirements for contemporary supply chains.

To Purchase a Comprehensive Report Analysis: https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/select-licence?rid=10565 Market Restraint Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance Challenges: The international blockchain regulatory framework is disjointed and continues to develop. Businesses encounter uncertainty around the alignment of blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and digital identities with local compliance regulations, including GDPR, HIPAA, and financial reporting standards. The intricate regulatory landscape, especially for cross-border operations, obstructs comprehensive BaaS implementations and introduces legal and reputational risks. High Implementation and Integration Costs: While BaaS diminishes the price associated with constructing blockchain infrastructure from the ground up, overall implementation costs might be considerable. Organizations must allocate resources for customisation, user training, legacy system integration, and post-deployment maintenance. For SMEs, the initial and recurring expenses remain high, deterring adoption despite the technology's promise for long-term ROI. Limited Availability of Blockchain Expertise: Blockchain continues to be a specialized competency inside the global labor market. Many firms lack the internal technical expertise necessary to efficiently implement, scale, and secure BaaS infrastructures. The learning curve related to distributed ledger technologies, consensus processes, and smart contract programming hinders implementation deadlines. This skills deficit increases dependence on external consultants and impedes innovation cycles. Geographical Dominance North America possesses the predominant stake in the Blockchain As A Service (BaaS) industry, propelled by early adoption in financial services, healthcare, and logistics. The existence of influential major actors, along with robust regulatory support for digital transformation, drives regional growth.

ASP - Alternative strategy portfolio. Capitalized Interest - The total of i) interest cost for project specific debt on properties that are under development or redevelopment plus ii) an imputed interest cost for properties that are under development or redevelopment, which is calculated based on the Company's equity investment in those properties multiplied by the Company's consolidated weighted average borrowing rate. Capitalized Interest is a component of the carrying value of a development or redevelopment property. CMBS Investments - Investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Consolidated securitization vehicle - CMBS securitization trusts for which the terms of our investment and special servicing assignment give us the ability to direct the activities that could significantly impact the trust's economic performance Debt service coverage - Operating Income adding back income taxes, loan loss reserves and the Company's share of joint venture depreciation and amortization, divided by total interest and principal payments. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre) - EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in September 2017 defines EBITDAre as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures.

Fixed charge - Total payments for interest, loan principal amortization, ground rent and preferred stock dividends. Fixed charge coverage - Operating Income adding back income taxes, loan loss reserves and the Company's share of joint venture depreciation and amortization, divided by Fixed Charge. The calculation of fixed charge coverage for purposes of our credit facility covenants is governed by the terms of the credit facility. Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) - FAD is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as FFO plus non-real estate depreciation, allowance for straight line credit loss, adjustment for straight line operating lease rent, non-cash deferred compensation, and pro- rata adjustments for these items from the Company's unconsolidated JVs, less straight line rental income, free rent net of amortization, second cycle tenant improvement and leasing costs, and recurring capital expenditures. Funds from Operations (FFO) - FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended in December 2018, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Junior Mortgage Participations - Subordinate interests in first mortgages. Mezzanine Debt - Loans secured by ownership interests in real estate. Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI - NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as operating income before transaction related costs, gains/losses on early extinguishment of debt, marketing general and administrative expenses and non-real estate revenue. Cash NOI is also a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by subtracting free rent (net of amortization), straight-line rent, and the amortization of acquired above and below-market leases from NOI, while adding operating lease straight-line adjustment and the allowance for straight-line tenant credit loss. Preferred Equity Investments - Equity investments that are senior to common equity and are entitled to preferential returns. Recurring capital expenditures - Building improvements and leasing costs required to maintain current revenues. Recurring capital expenditures do not include building improvements that are incurred to bring a property up to ""operating standards."" Redevelopment costs - Non-recurring capital expenditures incurred to improve properties to the Company's operating standards. Right of Use Assets / Lease Liabilities - Represents the right to control the use of leased property and the corresponding obligation, both measured at inception as the present value of the lease payments. The asset and related liability are classified as either operating or financing based on the length and cost of the lease and whether the lease contains a purchase option or a transfer of ownership. Operating leases are expensed through operating lease rent while financing leases are expensed through amortization and interest expense. Supplemental Information 4 First Quarter 2025 DEFINITIONS Same-Store Properties (Same-Store) - Properties owned in the same manner during both the current and prior year, excluding development and redevelopment properties that are not stabilized for both the current and prior year. Changes to Same-Store properties in 2025 are as follows: Added to Same-Store in 2025: Removed from Same-Store in 2025: 7 Dey Street 10 East 53rd Street (interest acquired) 760 Madison Avenue - Retail 15 Beekman Street 245 Park Avenue Second generation TIs and LCs - Tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and other leasing costs that do not meet the definition of first generation TIs and LCs.

IBM,2025-04-11 12:01:51,These Were the Most Expensive Computers Ever Built,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-were-the-most-expensive-computers-ever-built-20250411.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"The most expensive computers ever built far exceed what you might expect regarding overall pricing. Since the dawn of computing, a certain premium has been attached to performance. I&#8217;m not talking about your standard laptop or Chromebook, but something with a bit more oomph behind it. Unlike your standard computers, the computers we&#8217;re focusing on today are above and beyond what you might expect when it comes to both cost and raw power. Semi-Automatic Ground Environment System Operating from 1958 until the early 1980s, the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment, or SAGE, was one of the most expensive computers ever built. This was a custom-built network of computers intended for monitoring American air space during the Cold War. At the time of its completion, these computer pairs ran the American government a cool $5 billion, compared to the $2 billion it took to envision and complete the Manhattan Project. Adjusted for inflation, the entire project would equal about $56 billion today. Fugaku Supercomputer Developed in 2020, the Fugaku Supercomputer once held the record for the world&#8217;s fastest supercomputer. However, when looking at overall costs, it remains one of the most expensive computers in history. With an estimated cost of $1.2 billion, Fugaku was the crown jewel of Fujitsu&#8217;s computer development. Interestingly, this was achieved with ARM processors, not too dissimilar to the CPUs that power a mobile phone or tablet. Sunway TaihuLight With a development price of $273 million, the Sunway Taihulight seems almost like a bargain compared to the previous two entries. For two years, the TaihuLight was the most powerful computer on the planet, completing operations at 93 petaflops. It has since fallen in its rankings as the progress of technology marches on. However, compared to many of its contemporaries, it still can do some solid work in forecasting and industrial design. Sierra Sierra was built for a fairly ghastly purpose, the simulation of nuclear armanents and their effects. With an estimated cost of $325 million, it is one of the most expensive computers to come out of the United States. Unlike SAGE, Sierra was entirely spearheaded by IBM, one of the old stalwarts when it comes to computing. It consistently ranks in the top 10 when looking at the world&#8217;s supercomputers, something it maintains despite its 2018 debut. IBM Roadrunner Roadrunner is a predecessor of sorts to the previously mentioned Sierra. Built for a similar overall puprose of nuclear weapons simulation, Roadrunner was once the fastest computer on the planet. This one set the United States government back a cool $100 million in 2008 and boasted impressive specs for the time. Curiously, IBM leveraged enough processing power to equal a data center for any major website. It&#8217;s since been dismantled, running its last tasks in 2013. Tianhe-2 Serving as TaihuLight&#8217;s immediate predecessor, the Tianhe-2 took a remarkable team of 1,300 scientists and engineers to complete. At the time of its completion in 2013, it served as the fastest supercomputer in the world. It has since been surpassed by newer and greater computers, but the cost alone keeps it in the higher tiers of the most expensive computers ever built. At the time of its completion, it ran up a bill of around 2.4 billion Yuan, or $390 million. Given its role as a simulation and data analysis machine, that might have been worth every penny. Blue Waters Developed in 2013 thanks to a grant program from the National Science Foundation, Blue Waters has some impressive stats behind it. It boasted 25 petabytes of storage, which is enough for the entirety of the written word throughout all of human history. Additionally, you&#8217;re looking at another 500 petabytes of storage on removable media, with the processor handling 13 quadrillion calculations every second. At $208 million, this is arguably one of the cheapest entries on our list. That said, it remains one of the most powerful and expensive computers to see consistent use. IBM Sequoia Coming in at an estimated cost of $250 million, IBM&#8217;s Sequoia is another supercomputer showing the manufacturer&#8217;s prowess. Sequoia served a similar purpose as its descendants, focusing primarily on the simulation of nuclear arms. It was also used for astronomy, sequencing the human genome, and analyzing and simulating the effects of climate change. While its time in the sun has long since passed, thanks to its dismantling in 2020, it ran for a respectable 8 years before the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory pulled the plug. Summit The most recent of IBM&#8217;s supercomputers on this list, the Summit is one of the few projects to be built for the express purpose of nuclear simulation. That said, it is an astounding example of scale when compared to other supercomputers. With an estimated cost of $325 million, Summit isn&#8217;t in the top slot of the most expensive computers to ever exist. Statistics-wise, we&#8217;re looking at some remarkable feats, with 136 miles of cabling and 5,600 square feet needed to even get the computer operational. The International Space Station I know this isn&#8217;t a single computer. However, the International Space Station&#8217;s computer systems are integral to its continued operation. Now, the $100 billion required to build the ISS isn&#8217;t allocated solely for its computers. There are many systems in place. However, it is fair to say the computers of the world&#8217;s most expensive object are worth considering. Use Cases As you&#8217;ve likely seen throughout today&#8217;s list, these computers aren&#8217;t intended for surfing the web or checking emails. Most supercomputers are built for handling massive amounts of data. When running complex simulations and the like, the more throughput you have, the faster calculations get done. As such, it only makes sense that most nations around the world will turn to purpose-built supercomputers to handle things. Is It Worth the Price of Admission? That&#8217;s up for debate. I certainly can&#8217;t fathom greenlighting a computer that costs millions to billions of dollars. With that in mind, it isn&#8217;t likely that you&#8217;re going to be handling weather simulation on a MacBook, so there&#8217;s probably a reason why these computers remain a fixture in science and academia.

For this list, we consulted the data published by the United States Census Bureau in November of 2024, titled U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES, SEPTEMBER 2024. This data is current as of September 2024. Background on the U.S. Balance of Trade An image depicting international trade, most of which takes place through container ships. In order to understand the balance of trade for the United States, it is important to clear up some misconceptions, and fear, surrounding a trade deficit. Too often, elected officials spread fear and anger about the trade deficit without fully understanding how it works themselves, or why they are worried about it themselves. If they do understand but continue to spread misinformation and fear, then we should take a good, hard look at why they are in office. To begin, a trade deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports. A country with a high population with large amounts of discretionary income will always consume more than it produces. This trade deficit is usually accompanied by (but not necessarily tied to or causal with) public debt. When a country begins to export more goods than it imports, known as a trade surplus, the trade deficit will shrink. The United States had its last trade surplus in 1975 and has maintained a trade deficit ever since. Here are things to know about trade deficits. First, a trade deficit isn’t necessarily bad. The idea that trade deficits should be avoided or eliminated is rejected by all economists and trade experts. Trade deficits in the United States usually only increase when the U.S. economy is growing because American citizens are able to buy more things that they want which are produced abroad, rather than living paycheck to paycheck and only paying for necessities that are produced at home. Second, American companies usually exacerbate the problem of trade deficits and make them worse by taking advantage of recessions and economic hardship by transferring manufacturing and programming jobs to cheaper labor overseas and replacing them with low-paying service jobs here in the United States. Third, it isn’t your job to fix the deficit. Consumers will buy the best product that fits their needs and their budget. If that product happens to be imported from a foreign country, it doesn’t matter to them. Their families need to eat, they need cars to travel, they need clothes to wear, and books to learn. Asking American consumers to buy a more expensive alternative simply because it is produced domestically, even though they can barely afford the imported version, is putting the responsibility on the end user to fix the situation instead of those who created the problem in the first place: corporations and politicians. Fourth, countries export services as well as goods. In the case of the United States, however, the goods we import far outweigh the services we import, and sometimes we have a trade surplus for services. Fifth, many of the goods we import, including some on this list, are from companies that are based within the United States already. These companies produce or manufacture goods for pennies overseas before importing them to the United States to be sold for high premiums. Everything from clothing to Apple computers, and medicine to smartphones. High tariffs, aggressive foreign policies, and other antagonistic behavior toward our trade partners will do nothing but make this problem worse. #5 Computers A photo of the Apple logo. Imports in 2024: $89,137 million It should be no surprise that computers are on this list, since most computers of all prices and capabilities are produced outside the United States, and those that are produced domestically are usually outperformed in both quality and capabilities by foreign competitors. This category includes everything for desktop computers, tablets, laptops, and other specialty computers. Most of the products in this category come from China, with Mexico in a close second. #5 Computers (Cont.) Most companies prefer to produce their computers in foreign countries that take advantage of cheap (often exploitative) labor but keep their headquarters or offices within the United States to take advantage of tax incentives and high-skill talent. The top companies importing computers include Apple, Dell, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Samsung, Toshiba, ASUS, and more. #4 Other Automotive Parts and Accessories A mechanic inspecting a car thermostat. Imports in 2024: $110,071 million This import category is different from engines and engine parts which has its own category. This would be everything outside of the engine but still needed for the car to operate properly or be allowed to be sold in the United States. #4 Other Automotive Parts and Accessories (Cont.) This covers everything from parts that are added by the auto company after the vehicle is completed but before it is sent to customers or dealers, replacement parts, special parts and features offered by the company, and more. Given the astronomical cost of insurance and cars in general and the ridiculous number of cars in the United States, it makes sense that car parts would be on this list. #3 Crude Oil An oil drill rig and pump jack in the Rechitsa region of Belarus. Imports in 2024: $126,560 million America loves oil. Besides our addiction to cars and driving, oil is used for dozens of other things we consume on a daily basis. The United States, like other countries, imports crude oil and refines it in domestic refineries into things like gasoline, diesel, synthetic rubber, asphalt, lubricants, plastic, refrigerants, paint, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, fertilizer, and other things. The position of crude oil on this list can fluctuate wildly depending on the time of year, the global supply of crude oil, and international politics. #3 Crude Oil (Cont.) For better or worse, it is safe to say that America as we know it would cease to exist without the import of crude oil. The peak of crude oil production is expected to happen in or before 2035 when climate change mitigation policies and renewable energy will finally begin (hopefully) to reach mass adoption. #2 Passenger Cars Most cars sit in lots like this for months while they wait to be sold. Imports in 2024: $162,140 million Of the five imports on this list, three of them are related directly to America’s absolute, all-powerful obsession with cars and driving. We had car parts, then crude oil, and now passenger cars themselves. When you look at the culture of America in general, this should come as no surprise. #2 Passenger Cars (Cont.) We need cars to work, visit family, buy groceries, participate in our public services and responsibilities, and more. We even need cars to go buy more cars. Many families have more than two or three vehicles each. We have autoplexes and dealerships, drive-in theaters, car washes, auto repair shops, car detail shops, racetracks, multi-level parking garages, thousands of miles of roads in every city, parking lots that stretch for miles, and gas stations at almost every intersection. Garages come standard with every home. We love our cars. #1 Pharmaceutical Preparations A man looking through medicines, most of which was produced overseas. Imports in 2024: $178,440 million This category includes the final pharmaceutical itself, as well as the ingredients or components that will be combined to create the final pharmaceutical product. Given the astronomical price of healthcare and medicine in the United States, it makes sense that pharmaceuticals will be near the top of the list. The American healthcare system incentivizes large healthcare companies to produce and manufacture medicines for extremely low prices in foreign countries before importing them to be sold at huge markups in domestic markets. 100 Million Americans Are Missing This Crucial Retirement Tool The thought of burdening your family with a financial disaster is most Americans’ nightmare.
