BBY,2025-06-04 16:10:02,These Are America’s 10 Favorite Retail Stores,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-are-americas-10-favorite-retail-stores-20250604.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Over the last decade, shopping has changed. This change has occurred worldwide, most notably in technologically advanced countries like America. We once ventured out to &#8220;run errands&#8221;, a frequent activity that often included a stop at the mall or a trip to the local boutique. But with Amazon reigning supreme and tons of huge brands like Walmart and Target focusing on online sales, the nature of shopping in America has been drastically altered. With online retail comes the opportunity to reach any segment of the population from anywhere in the world. As competition skyrockets, brand recognition, marketing, and advertising become crucial to a company&#8217;s success. To find the 10 retail stores Americans love most, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the recent 2025 Axios Harris Poll 100 Reputation Rankings. This consumer survey ranked 100 brands, giving each a score. These were accessed across several categories, such as Character, Trust, Growth, Vision, and Ethics. Depending on the exact score, these brands fell into 6 separate rankings: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor. In the retail store category, 15 brands made Axios&#8217; list; however, only 10 of these fell into the top 3 rankings. Here, we list the retail stores Americans think fall under Excellent, Good, and Very Good. 10.

BBY,2025-04-16 12:30:14,Why Do Chase Shopping Offers Feel Blah Compared to Capital One’s 100+ Deals?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/why-do-chase-shopping-offers-feel-blah-compared-to-20250416.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"In the world of cash-back credit cards, Chase and Capital One are undoubtedly two of the best places to start. With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it’s concerning that this isn’t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it’s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy’s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I’m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You’ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster’s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One’s layout is far easier to navigate, but it’s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn’t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache.

BBY,2025-04-11 12:02:37,Flip Side Founder Recalls Days When Record Stores Were Hallowed Ground,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/flip-side-founder-recalls-days-when-record-stores-were-hallowed-20250411.jpg,https://www.patch.com,"CHICAGO — If you’re of a certain age — we won’t say what age — you probably experienced the joy of camping out in front of a Flip Side Records store waiting for the Ticketron outlet to open so you could buy tickets for The Who. Just in time for Record Store Day 2025, Larry Rosenbaum, 81, recalls the glory days of Flip Side Records, the greatest record store chain in Chicagoland history, that he co-founded with his brother, Carl, 83, in “The Flip Side: Where Chicago Rocked” (Eckharzt Press). From 1968 to 1995, Flip Side ruled Chicago’s record market, with locations tucked away in strip malls and storefronts across the city and suburbs. The concert arm of the Rosenbaum brothers’ enterprise was Celebration Flip Side, which produced all the big concerts of the 1970s and 1980s. Carl and Larry weren’t necessarily into music, growing up on Chicago’s North Side in West Ridge (West Rogers Park). They just wanted to be their own boss. “We were working for an electronics parts distributor in 1968,” Larry, 81, told Patch. “We were interested in going into business ourselves. Our choices were narrowed down to a record store, Vienna hot dog stand and a dry cleaner. Our dad was a CPA and one of his clients owned a lucrative dry cleaning business.” Both brothers were in their early 20s, married and with babies, because that’s what you did back then. “We decided on a record store,” Larry said. “Interestingly enough, we weren’t into music. We were just looking for a business to get into.” The brothers made a deal with the landlord for a former bakery on Foster Avenue between Kedzie and Kimball. “We were in the record business,” Larry said. Their stiffest competition was another record store four blocks away called Little Al’s Records that had been around forever. One day, when Larry was working on turning the bakery into a record store, he saw a big fat guy staring through the window. It was Little Al. “He took us out for coffee. He said he was going to do stuff to make us fail, but figured we’d just fail anyway,” Larry recalled. “At 22, it scared the crap out of me. From a competitive angle, here’s a big fat schlub coming in and telling us we were going to fail. We were each married with one kid. This was how we were going to make a living.” The brothers would go on to prove Little Al wrong. Looking for a name for their new venture, a young marketing executive, who lived in the apartment next door to Larry, came up with the name Flip Side. “The timing was great,” Larry said. “It was a great time to be in the music business, especially in the 1970s.” People line up in front of a Flip Side store in 1975, waiting to buy Rolling Stones tickets. Feeding the rock-crazed young consumers on Chicago’s Northwest Side, Carl came up with the idea to go over to the Aragon Ballroom in Uptown to sell records when rock acts were playing at the venue. “We made a deal with the owner,” Larry said. “Every weekend during shows, we’d pack up an old station wagon and set up in the corner.” Among the many innovations Flip Side contributed to the music biz was bringing Ticketron outlets — the original computerized ticket company — into the stores. The cover of the music business bio features a line of people outside a Flip Side store in 1975 waiting to buy tickets to see Rolling Stones at the Chicago Stadium. ""Because of the contacts we made at the Aragon, we ultimately got into the concert business ourselves, promoting concerts. Back in the 1970s, we were the premiere concert promoters in Chicago. We worked with the Loop, WCKG and WXRT. “We would contract with bands, sign the bands from the first step to the stage, from the Rollling Stones to the Who to Cheap Trick to Steve Martin,” Larry said. At its peak, Flip Side had 21 stores in Chicago, Hoffman Estates, Schaumburg, Buffalo Grove, Downers Grove, Naperville and Wheaton, to name a few. The Rosenbaums kept Flip Side going until 1995 when they closed their last store, after Best Buy and Circuit City entered the record biz. “[Best Buy and Circuit City] wanted to get people in their stores and used CDs as a loss-leader,” Larry said. “Within three years, they put every privately owned regional chain out of business. They killed the market. If you go to a Best Buy now, you can’t find any records or CDs. After a few years, both got out of the music business.” “The Flip Side: Where Chicago Rocked,” by Carl and Larry Rosenbaum, with Ken Churilla, is available through Erkhartz Press and Amazon. The oral history covers the life spans of the iconic record store chain as well as their concert business, encompassing the classic rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s. “The best way to sum it up, at least for my brother and me, to use the words of the Grateful Dead, 'what a long, strange trip it's been,'” Larry said. “It was a great run, the friends we made, the lives we impacted, there just isn’t any words.” In honor of Record Store Day Saturday, April 12, Larry Rosenbaum will be signing copies of the book from11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the legendary Val’s Halla, 239 Harrison St., Oak Park. After Oak Park, Larry will be zooming up to Scratched Vinyl, 119 Barrington Commons Court, Barrington, from 2 to 3 p.m. Record Store Day is a global event that celebrates the vanishing independent record shops, hallowed grounds that once flourished on street corners and downtown shopping districts during the pre-digital and streaming age. Special vinyl and CD exclusives and various promotional products are also made for the day, released only to independently owned record shops, along with RSD first and small run/regional releases.

The Dow Jones is down 3.72%, the Nasdaq is down more than 5%, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO) is down 3.93% as of 10:25 a.m. ET. Why is the market selling off? Tariffs announced by the Trump Administration are estimated to reduce trade by $900 billion this year. Almost every Wall Street bank is now pulling back economic growth estimates for the year. Tariff rates on other countries announced last night range from 10% to more than 50%. As of 2022, the United States had a weighted-average tariff rate of about 1.5%. However, after Trump&#8217;s tariff announcement yesterday the United States would have a weighted average tariff rate of 29%. Another issue driving stocks down today is the fact these tariffs appear to be less of a &#8216;negotiating tactic&#8217; and something that will be in place for a prolonged period of time. For example, both Vietnam and Israel announced large cuts to tariffs on U.S. goods, but saw reciprocal tariff rates of 46% and 17%, respectively. What Stocks Are Falling in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF? What stocks in the VOO are seeing the biggest declines today? Retailers and Clothing: Williams-Sonoma is down 18.1%, Deckers Outdoor down 16.9%, Ralph Lauren down 16.9%, and Nike down 13%. Each of these companies faces not only reduced consumer spending if a recession happens but also have overseas supply chains that would see significant tariff impacts if these tariffs take effect as presented on April 9th. Consumer Electronics: Dell is down 15.3%, HP is down 15.7%, and Best Buy is down 15.8%. Once again, these companies not only face reduced consumer demand but significant tariffs on their products. Apple was down 9% in early trading but has trimmed its losses to 7.9%.

The impact of these levies—targeting everyday items like clothing, electronics, and groceries—will ripple through consumer spending habits and drive up costs in sectors where affordability is already a concern.Economists from Bank of America and BNP Paribas expect the February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report to provide the first clear indications of these tariffs&#8217; effect, with further increases anticipated in the coming months. As US retailers, including Target and Best Buy, brace for higher costs, long-term inflation expectations have climbed to near 30-year highs. The burden will fall hardest on those already struggling with rising living expenses, as businesses pass higher import costs onto consumers.Low-income consumers hit hardest by rising costsFamilies with tighter budgets, who typically allocate a larger share of their income to necessities, are particularly vulnerable to these price hikes. Goods sourced from China, Mexico, and Canada—such as furniture, fresh produce, and energy supplies—are becoming more expensive, compounding financial pressures on low-income consumers who have been dealing with high inflation and borrowing costs.Retail giants have already signaled that price increases are inevitable. Target CEO Brian Cornell has warned that tariffs on key imports, such as Mexican fruits and vegetables, will make it challenging to maintain stable pricing.Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, has also noted growing &#8220;stress behaviors&#8221; among budget-conscious shoppers, with some switching to smaller pack sizes or opting for less expensive alternatives. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Walmart has begun negotiating with Chinese suppliers, requesting price cuts of up to 10% to mitigate the effects of tariffs. However, such efforts may not be enough to shield customers from rising costs.Inflation concerns escalate as consumer spending slowsHigher import duties are expected to act as a hidden tax on consumers, further slowing already tepid spending growth. The Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book report has highlighted increased price sensitivity among shoppers, particularly for non-essential items.This shift in consumer behavior suggests that inflationary pressures are reshaping purchasing decisions, leading to a decline in demand for discretionary goods.David French, executive vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, has pointed out that these tariffs function as a &#8220;consumption tax,&#8221; disproportionately affecting lower-income families. Unlike traditional tax policies, these trade levies increase the cost of essential goods, making it harder for vulnerable households to maintain their standard of living.The economic consequences of these tariffs are particularly stark for households at the lower end of the income spectrum. Between February 2020 and June 2024, the poorest 20% of US households experienced an 8.3% faster rise in consumer prices compared to the wealthiest segment, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.This divergence in inflation rates has contributed to broader economic discontent, influencing voter sentiment in the 2024 election cycle.Trump’s tariff strategyDonald Trump’s current trade policies mark a significant shift from his first-term tariff approach, which initially focused on industrial materials like steel and aluminum. This time, the measures are far more aggressive, pushing average US tariff rates to their highest levels since World War II.The latest round of levies includes a broad array of consumer goods, raising concerns about prolonged inflationary effects.Despite the financial strain on households, the White House has defended the policy, arguing that tariffs will ultimately benefit American workers and businesses. A White House spokesperson stated that the administration’s strategy aims to &#8220;raise wages, create jobs, and expand investment,&#8221; dismissing concerns about short-term price increases as a &#8220;little disturbance&#8221; that the economy can absorb.However, for many American families already facing financial hardship, the reality is far more immediate. The combination of tariffs, stagnant wages, and existing economic pressures is making it increasingly difficult for some households to afford basic necessities.As the effects of these tariffs take hold, the question remains: how will struggling consumers navigate an economy where the cost of living continues to climb?The post US tariffs fuel inflation, putting pressure on low-income households appeared first on Invezz",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/11/us-tariffs-fuel-inflation-putting-pressure-on-low-income-households/
