The London-based stockbroker has repeated a ‘Buy’ recommendation with a price target pitched at 45p, compared to Arrow’s current market price of around 16.3p. Earlier today, Arrow reported a 36% increase in total oil and gas revenue, reaching US$19.51 million. First quarter earnings (EBITDA) climbed 15% to US$11.53 million, whilst net income amounted to US$2.66 million for the quarter. It comes as the growing oil and gas group continues to develop its fields in Colombia, with new horizontal wells unlocking higher volumes. Production increased to 4,085 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), up 50% compared to the same period a year ago. Operating cash flow totalled $14.43 million, and the company ended the quarter with $24.95 million in cash, after $11.38 million of capex in the three-month period. Arrow drilled two development wells, AB 2 and AB 3, in the Alberta Llanos field. It also completed a 90 km² seismic survey on the southeast Tapir Block. Post-quarter, Arrow spudded the AB HZ4 horizontal well and entered into a US$20 million prepayment agreement with an integrated energy firm to market its Colombian oil. ""The first quarter of 2025 has been exciting for Arrow,” chief executive Marshall Abbott said in a statement. Regular drilling, regular news flow Zeus Capital analyst Daniel Slater, in a note, highlighted that Arrow’s schedule of drilling will provide catalysts for the company to raise its valuation. “Going forward, we look for ongoing execution of the 2025 work programme, and for this to support higher production rates to help underpin our full year forecasts,” Slater said. The analyst added: “These results demonstrate the company’s ability to generate production cash flows to fund its significant ongoing 2025 drilling programme, while also building the balance sheet cash position. “While we will need to see a ramp up in production over the rest of the year in order to make our forecasts, the company is well placed to do this given the increased drilling programme that is planned.” Horizontal development Arrow boss Marshall Abbott today told investors that recent well successes - AB 2 and AB 3 – in the Alberta Llanos field highlighted the potential for horizontal development in the Ubaque reservoir, as well as follow-up zones in the C7 and Guadalupe zones. ""During the dry summer months in the Llanos basin, the company has developed a new road system from the Carrizales Norte pad to the Capullo pad, the Mateguafa Oeste pad and the Mateguafa Attic pad,” Abbott said. “These pads will be utilised in the company's planned drilling program for the remainder of 2025. The company has secured a second rig which is expected to spud the first of four wells at RCE in early June."" Abbott, meanwhile, highlighted that Arrow retains “very healthy netbacks” on its production, in spite of the oil price volatility seen in global markets through early 2025. He noted that the focus is on growing production, continuing development at the Carrizales Norte, Rio Cravo Este and Alberta Llanos fields. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST, ETR:CTO) posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates, as the membership-only warehouse retailer saw its sales jump 8% year-over-year. For the fiscal third quarter which ended on May 11, revenue was $63.2 billion, ahead of the $63.19 billion expected by analysts. Profit for the quarter was $1.9 billion or $4.28 per share, beating estimates of $4.24. Costco does provide an annual outlook, but during its earnings call, CEO Ron Vachris addressed the impact of tariffs. The CEO said the company has proactively managed tariff challenges by accelerating shipments, sourcing more American-made products, and frequently adjusting prices to minimize cost impacts. The company’s tariff exposure is well-managed, analysts at Jefferies believe. “Costco re-confirmed that roughly a third of US sales are imported from other countries, including 8% from China, which drove positive low-single-digit percentage inflation in non-food items,” they wrote. “Management noted rerouting these goods to non-US markets, advancing summer goods, and boosting locally sourced production in the US and Asia, which has lowered member prices by 40% in some regions.” The analysts also highlighted Costco’s efforts to enhance the member experience through technology pilots, such as its expedited checkout technology, ‘Scan-and-Go.’ “Combined with the integration of digital membership cards and improvements in digital wallet usage, management noted improved throughput, evidenced by the immediate positive impact on gas station gallon sales,” analysts wrote. Market share gains ahead Jefferies maintained its 'Buy' rating on Costco following the company’s “strong print” for Q1, noting it is well-positioned for further share gains ahead. “Costco is a defensive name by nature due to its membership model that generates predictable sales and profits, an attractive value orientation, a higher-income customer, and a relatively significant penetration of consumables as a percentage of sales,” they wrote. “Additionally, the company continues to open new clubs in the US, has a meaningful runway for ongoing international expansion, notably China, and recently raised its membership prices.” The analysts have a price target of $1,180 on Costco, reflecting upside of 17% at the time of writing.

It is a necessary qualifying component of the KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols for financial professionals, and is implemented to establish levels of investment risk that a new customer is comfortable taking. While the ideal investment delivers big capital appreciation and AAA principal safety, the maxim “no guts no glory” applies also to investing, where the largest returns are generally the ones that are the riskiest ventures. Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are a popular vehicle for diversified investments, as they can be bought and sold online with ease and are usually subject to lower fees than mutual funds. ETFs come in a wide range of configurations, and are generally passively managed and designed to mimic the performance of designated market indexes. Key Points Dividend growth, in the majority of cases, is a stock indicator of a company’s business success, since dividend growth usually is commensurate with profit growth. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF is a popular ETF platform for investors to avail themselves of blue chip companies with a steady track record for both dividend increases and price appreciation growth. Deployment of a dividend reinvestment protocol can substantially boost overall ROI for investments in an ETF such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF.

Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) For those investors who have found the S&amp;P 500 Index too volatile for their liking, there is another index that offers steady growth, albeit at a slower pace, combined with a strong income component and lower volatility. The S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index is one such benchmark. Containing Dividend Kings (50 or more consecutive years of increased dividends) and Dividend Aristocrats (25 or more years in a row of increased dividends), this index contains Fortune 500 companies whose businesses are historically profitable enough that they can afford to continue higher dividend payouts year after year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VIG) is a popular ETF with a portfolio reflecting this exact index. Founded in 2006, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF strives for a mix of capital appreciation and income from dividend growth companies, i.e. those with a history of dividend increases accompanying growth. Its yield is 1.87% and it has a 0.05% expense ratio. The dividend increases have to be consistent for a minimum of 10 years to warrant inclusion. Surprisingly, the top 25% companies with the highest yields are excluded from the 330+ stocks on the VIG roster. VIG has a Morningstar gold ETF ranking. It had $101.79 billion assets under management (AUM) as of the time of this writing. A look at VIG’s top 10 holdings shows how its criteria differ from S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs, which are usually led by Magnificent 7 stocks, based on market cap size: Broadcom Microsoft Apple Eli Lilly JP Morgan Chase Visa, Inc. Exxon Mobil MasterCard Costco Wholesale Walmart The VIG Dividend Difference As the calculator demonstrates, a $15,000 investment in VIG back in January, 2020 would be worth $25,833.91 today, at the time of this writing, which equates to a 72.23% ROI. The total return would be $10,833.91. The annualized return equates to 10.62%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value is $2,425.58. The actual cash dividends paid out from the initial 119.67 shares equates to $1,849.45. If the dividends are not reinvested, the total return would be $8,408.33. Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return differential of $2,425.58 over the 5 year span. The Dividend Reinvestment Advantage For Safer Returns Dividend stocks with annual payout growth can boost capital appreciation through compounding, or provide extra income in the case of emergencies. As the charts demonstrate, reinvesting dividends contributed a 22% boost to ROI, while overall capital appreciation growth still averaged over 10% annually. Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIP) can automatically implement purchases of additional shares without additional fees or order entries, if one is so inclined. In the case of an ETF such as VIG, investors with weaker stomachs for volatility can sleep more easily, knowing that their portfolios are still growing albeit without the roller coaster ride delivered by Nvidia, for example. Another plus to VIG is that since it contains both current and potential future Dividend King and Dividend Aristocrat stocks, the dividend amounts will continue to grow with each passing year. This will, in turn, increase the amount of additional shares that can be obtained under a DRIP agreement. This is a classic compounding model for health building that can work for the benefit of many investors. On the contingency side, the investor can always cancel the DRIP agreement if there is an emergency need for the dividend income pending, since it can always be renewed at a later date after the crisis has passed.

For bearish-leaning risk takers, the SPXS ETF offers powerful leverage when the S&amp;P 500 declines. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) The first quarter of this year reminded optimistic investors that stocks don&#8217;t only go up. Trade war tensions, recession worries, and other factors could spur a market crash in 2025. Instead of using fancy strategies like short-selling stocks or buying put options, there&#8217;s an easier way that doesn&#8217;t require a margin account. Bearish-leaning investors can profit from a stock market crash of 20% or more by owning inverse exchange traded funds (ETFs). These funds are specifically designed to gain value when a stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, goes down. There are risks involved, to be sure, but the following three inverse ETFs could set you up for powerful returns if the market craters. ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (SH) The S&amp;P 500 is a commonly cited stock index that represents a broad selection of large-cap U.S.-focused companies. Therefore, a simple way to profit from a stock market crash would be to hold an inverse ETF that gains value when the S&amp;P 500 collapses. ProShares offers an ETF that serves this exact purpose. It&#8217;s a fund called the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SH), and it seeks to move inversely to the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500. What&#8217;s good about moving inversely to the S&amp;P 500 is that it&#8217;s usually a slower-moving index than the NASDAQ 100. Therefore, the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF should carry less risk than some other inverse ETFs. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 comprises a broad range of stocks from multiple market sectors. Some S&amp;P 500 component stocks include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Thus, you&#8217;re actually achieving what I call &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the SH ETF. Even with the somewhat de-risking effect of &#8220;inverse diversification,&#8221; the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF could gain value quickly if there&#8217;s a stock market crash. Be aware, though, that the SH ETF won&#8217;t necessarily move up at the exact same pace that the S&amp;P 500 goes down. That&#8217;s because the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 throughout the day but then resets and rebalances the next day. As ProShares explains, &#8220;For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target [i.e., the S&amp;P 500]. These differences may be significant.&#8221; To put it another way, you&#8217;ll get faithful inverse S&amp;P 500 tracking for a day with the SH ETF. However, the longer you hold the fund, the more the results can vary from what you might expect. Consequently, while the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF would probably make you money during a market crash, it&#8217;s not meant to be held for too long. ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) If you&#8217;re willing to accept more risk, consider that the NASDAQ 100 mostly covers only one market sector (technology) and only includes around 100 stocks (as opposed to around 500 stocks in the more diversified S&amp;P 500). So, an ETF that inversely tracks the NASDAQ 100 is somewhat riskier but could yield greater rewards in the event of a market crash. To that end, you might consider the ProShares Short QQQ ETF (NYSEARCA:PSQ). This fund inversely corresponds to the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 index. Bear in mind that the NASDAQ 100 is mainly focused on technology sector stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). You won&#8217;t get as much &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the ProShares Short QQQ ETF as you would get with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, but you could potentially achieve greater returns during a market crash with the PSQ ETF. Much like with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, the ProShares Short QQQ ETF is subject to unexpected results if you hold the fund for longer than a day. Hence, I&#8217;ll send out a similar warning: even if the stock market is collapsing, don&#8217;t hold the PSQ ETF for too long because the risks will probably increase over time. Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (SPXS) My third entry for the best inverse ETFs to profit in a market crash is the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXS). This, like the SH ETF, may be somewhat de-risked because it inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 and has &#8220;inverse diversification.&#8221; However, the SPXS ETF is still the riskiest fund on this list. What makes the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF so high-risk and potentially high-reward is that the fund is inverse and triple-leveraged. This means that the SPXS ETF, on a daily basis, moves three times as fast as the S&amp;P 500, but in the opposite direction. In theory, you might assume that the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF would go up 60% if the S&amp;P 500 goes down 20%. Again, however, there&#8217;s no assurance of faithful index tracking beyond one day. Hence, you could get highly unexpected results if you hold the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF for a long time. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s probably too risky to hold the SPXS ETF for more than a couple of weeks, even during a stock market crash. Besides, if the stock market suddenly rallies, the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF could make a triple-magnified move to the downside. The point is that the SPXS ETF is for nimble, sniper-like traders who can get into and out of a position quickly. If you prefer to take on less risk, consider the non-leveraged ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF or ProShares Short QQQ ETF.The post 3 Best Inverse ETFs to Profit in a Market Crash appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/05/22/3-best-inverse-etfs-to-profit-in-a-market-crash/

It edged out Microsoft, Toyota, Costco, and others. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The study&#8217;s methodology involved three waves of surveys. The first asked consumers to rank the best and worst companies. The second survey determined the 100 companies. The third asked about “contextual” issues, including opinions about brands and topics, including politics. These were in the field from January through mid-May. Following Trader Joe’s on the list were clothing company Patagonia, Microsoft, Toyota, and retail giant Costco. Trader Joe’s rose 12 spots from last year’s list. Trader Joe’s seems to have a cult following. It targets building local communities through grants to nonprofits, along with food and beverage donations, Trader Joe’s is known among its customers for an unusual level of transparency. This has to do with food prices, why some items are discontinued, and why prices differ from location to location. It also rarely sells products that carry another company’s brands Trader Joe’s also has several unique methods used to target customers. Its traditional direct marketing includes newsletters. Content in what it calls The Fearless Flyer is based on anecdotes and stories about products it sells. The theory behind it appears to be that it cements its relationship with shoppers. The company uses podcasts and recipes for similar reasons. Axios Harris Poll 100 produces non-traditional results. Trader Joe’s and Patagonia are niche companies. Microsoft, Toyota, and Costco are among the largest companies that do business in the United States, as well as among America’s most well-known brands. It also lists J.C.

With all the different perks and benefits available today, it makes perfect sense to shop around and find who offers the best deal. Key Points This Redditor is looking for a great combination of general and travel card. Sadly, they don’t want to live in a cash-back world. There are a few really strong recommendations that are worth considering. The right travel credit card can take you to places you’ve never dreamed of. Click here now to see our top picks. (Sponsor) This is precisely the situation with one Redditor posting on r/CreditCards, as they are looking to find the card that best matches their goals and travel needs. This individual is looking at travel as their primary goal, so all efforts here will be about earning miles and points. It’s a little confusing that the Redditor wants a card that excels for both general and travel purposes, as most cards do one or the other really well, but there is no harm in trying to find something that works. The Criteria With an income of over $300,000 and a FICO score of 800, this Redditor hopes to get a solid travel card that allows them to use points for domestic and international travel. Currently, they are okay with category-specific cards but do not favor rotating-category cards, which knocks some of the more popular cashback cards off the board. While they only travel once per year, either domestically or internationally, they have an international trip already planned, so it would be ideal to have a card they could use to rack up some points this year. As far as expenses, they have their once-yearly travel plans, a $5,000 monthly mortgage, a $500 HOA, and $350 in monthly utilities, none of which are paid by card. There is also a Costco membership, but this really isn’t a factor, and they already have a Costco Citi Visa, BoA unlimited cash rewards, BoA customized cash rewards, and a Discover card. So, after considering the AMEX Platinum and Bilt cards, they are still waiting to find something better. However, it’s worth noting that in the comments, they clarify that they are okay with an annual fee and the option to downgrade if they find themselves traveling less. The Options AMEX Platinum Among the top recommended options is a card that the original poster is already considering. The American Express Platinum card has a $695 annual fee, which is a definite negative, but it also has many bonuses to help offset this charge. However, before getting into the benefits, it&#8217;s worth knowing that the attractive 80,000 membership reward point bonus requires $8,000 in eligible purchases over 6 months. While we don’t know precisely what the Redditor spends monthly, this should be manageable based on their overall income and general spending habits. With this card, you get a $155 Walmart+ credit, a $200 hotel credit every year, a $240 digital entertainment credit, and a $200 airline fee credit, which means the $695 annual fee is offset by $900 in value when you also get a $15 Uber Cash credit every month. Capital One Venture X Another solid option for this Redditor might be the Capital One Venture X card. While it has a $395 annual fee, it offers a $300 annual travel credit, a $120 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit, 10,000 bonus miles (equivalent to $100) every year, and 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $4,000 in the first three months. Earning 10X miles on hotel and car rentals, 5X miles on flights, and 2X miles on all other purchases, this Redditor should have more than enough time to spend and save for their once-yearly big trip. Plus, you get access to more than 1,300 lounges, which could be beneficial if and when the original poster goes international and wants a nicer place to sit and wait for their flight. Chase Sapphire Preferred Among Chase’s best cards, this one offers an outstanding balance between general and travel spending, making it a top option. The Chase Sapphire Preferred has a $95 annual fee but offers 100,000 bonus points with just $5,000 in spending after 90 days, a pretty strong bonus overall. In addition, you get $200 in partner value from Chase partners, $50 statement credits every year when booking through Chase Travel, and 25% more value when rewards are redeemed for travel. To earn rewards, you can earn 2X on all travel purchases, 3X on dining out or taking in, 3X points on grocery purchases, and 3X on streaming services, so rewards can quickly add up.

In many ways, sticking with lower-stress roles while easing into retirement will let you enjoy more time in your day while still allowing income. .keypoints-box { margin-bottom: 20px; } Key Points This Redditor is one of many FIRE community members who want to keep some income while finding a lower-stress job. There is no shortage of opportunities for this Redditor, including roles as a librarian or working at Costco. This individual just needs to decide when and how to pull the trigger on walking away from their executive -level role. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) This is exactly the situation with one Redditor who posted in r/Fire, asking if it’s possible to easily transition from a high-level executive position to more of a 9-5 role. The hope is that they can discover whether others have done something similar and how successful this transition really was. It goes without saying that most people in high-stress roles would love an opportunity to move on to something that doesn’t make them hate going to work the next day. In this regard, we empathize with this Redditor in a big way. The Big Question As it stands today, our Redditor is a high-level executive in a financial role looking to potentially shift from his stressful, demanding career to more of a 9-5. They are very much looking to learn and understand what options are available if they walk away from the intensity of the corporate world. In its place, they want to move into a role that still offers benefits like employer-sponsored healthcare and stick with it until they reach the Medicare age of 65. Ultimately, healthcare is the biggest driver here, as they don’t want to be in a position where they need to utilize ACA plans. The original poster feels this will cost more in the long run, especially if you have multiple family members on a plan. This Redditor hopes to learn how others have handled similar transitions and to what degree of success they were able to walk away from the money into lower-stress opportunities. They are considering roles like a finance director position at a private school, a small restaurant chain, or a small office. There is also an option of getting out of finance altogether and becoming a librarian, so options are plentiful. Reddit Responds While there is an onslaught of comments in this thread about looking at volunteer roles at non-profits, etc., the original poster pushes back pretty fast. They are concerned that non-profit opportunities would likely not come with the necessary health benefits they want to maintain. They also indicate that transferring internally at their own company isn’t an option. They don&#8217;t believe that someone could successfully transition from a high-level to a clerical role internally in the current company. When the subject of potentially moving into freelance or consulting comes up, the Redditor doesn’t shut it down completely, but says they aren’t interested in chasing future clients on the regular. They might consider going to work at Costco, as one Redditor suggested as this is more enticing to them than freelance. The original poster does enjoy hearing about how one Redditor in the comments went from a VP at a digital advertising firm to selling paint at a local Sherwin-Williams. This commenter indicated their stress level dropped by 80%, which certainly caught the original posters attention. In the end, there are more than a dozen comments in this post from people who have done something similar, and all of them recommend the transition. While they say it won’t be easy, especially if they are working for people less qualified than them, once they get over the initial hurdles, the change is 100% worth the move. The Bottom Line If the biggest question is whether this Redditor can find a role with benefits, the answer is unequivocally yes. Any full-time retail position or in-office role at a small company would likely offer the healthcare benefits the Redditor doesn’t want to lose. While costs will vary based on the business and benefit level, there is little question they will be better and less expensive than ACA plans. The hope is that this individual will find their way, whether it’s working at a non-profit, Costco, or potentially even as a local bank teller. Their finance background would almost certainly get them to the top of a resume pile, at least that is the hope.

Economists predict that these tariffs will affect everything from groceries to car prices. With Americans already reeling from high prices at the grocery store, finding lower grocery prices may have a significant impact on your wallet. Economists predict the groceries that are likely to be the most impacted include fruits and vegetables imported from other countries, maple syrup, avocados, and imported alcohol such as beer, whiskey, and tequila. Walmart may be known for discount prices, but it&#8217;s not the only store that offers consumers great value. At 24/7 Wall St., we took a deep dive to find eight discount grocers across the country that can compete, or even go lower than Walmart&#8217;s prices. Read on for where you can find the best deals in your area. (This article was updated on April 2, 2025, to reflect recent economic news regarding the rising cost of products after President Trump&#8217;s newly imposed tariffs.) Why We&#8217;re Covering This Now Economists warn that already high grocery prices will continue to rise under President Trump&#8217;s new tariff plans. No one wants to break the bank when it comes to shopping for groceries and other everyday items. This is especially true today, as inflation is on the rise and prices are higher than ever (especially groceries!) But even though Walmart offers competitive low prices, you might not always be getting the best deals. 8. Market Basket Market Basket offers a lot of value for its customer base. Location: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island Number of Locations: 95 Known for: Being one of the least expensive groceries in the New England area, with a “more for your dollar” slogan Best things to buy: New England fish items like clams, fresh seafood, maple syrup, pears, apples More in Your Basket There is something special about Market Basket pricing. According to a recent study, Market Basket&#8217;s pricing was 18% lower than that of other Boston-area groceries. This study found that a family spending $250 per week on groceries could save as much as $2,300 annually by shopping at Market Basket. The privately owned business heavily focuses on keeping prices down, which has helped Market Basket earn a reputation as one of the cheapest grocery stores in the U.S. 7. Food 4 Less Food 4 Less is more than living up to its name. Location: California, Illinois, Indiana Number of locations: 101 Known for: A no-frills grocery store where customers bag their groceries Best things to buy: Organic orange juice, cage-free brown eggs, vegetable chips, and organic creamy peanut butter A Kroger Brand Food 4 Less is backed by its parent company, Kroger. Located in just four states, the Kroger-owned Food 4 Less brand is quickly becoming a go-to choice for customers looking for inexpensive groceries. These locations sell dry goods, canned goods, baking supplies, and organic and non-organic produce for less. The same can be said for health and beauty items, though Walmart has a larger selection overall. 6. H-E-B H-E-B is a bona fide Texas staple. Location: Texas and Mexico Number of locations: 400 Known for: Being region-specific to just Texas, with 380 stores in Texas and a few dozen in Mexico Best things to buy: Whataburger sauces, Texas-branded products, Taste of San Antonio, fajitas, tortillas, and more Better in Texas H-E-B offers food items you can&#8217;t find at your local Walmart. As Texans believe everything is better in Texas, this might be true if you shop at a H-E-B grocery store. Considered one of the best privately owned groceries in the country, H-E-B pricing compares very well to Walmart while offering things you can’t get at any Walmart location. However, where H-E-B truly wins is its low-priced yet outstanding quality meats and produce, which Walmart cannot match. 5. Lidl Lidl is attempting to enter the US market. Location: Eastern U.S. Number of locations: 185 Known for: Fantastic selection of low-price items, including store-brand items, which account for 80% of the store’s inventory Best things to buy: Seafood and dairy, organic meats, organic fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and fair-trade chocolates Store-Branded Everything With its competitive pricing, Lidl will grow quickly in the US. Another international brand trying to carve out a niche in the United States, Lidl is already well on its way to success. With 185 stores and growing, Lidl beats out Walmart in the idea that over 80% of the items in Lidl stores are store-branded. This means they are cheaper than brand-name items and even cheaper than Walmart’s private-label brands. Ultimately, Lidl is cheaper and healthier with grass-fed meats, organic fruits and vegetables, and organic dairy products. 4. WinCo Foods WinCo Foods is a surprisingly delightful place to shop due to its pricing. Location: Western U.S. Number of locations: 141 Known for: Midwest-based employee-owned grocery store with more than 20,000 employees Best things to buy: Boxed foods, dairy products, and bulk cheeses are said to save customers a lot of money The Midwest Surprise You won&#8217;t be disappointed with the price when you enter WinCo Foods. With only 141 employee-owned locations in the Midwest, many Americans can’t walk into a WinCo Foods store. However, for those who can, the bulk purchase area in its stores can be vastly cheaper than Walmart. Everything from Arizona Iced Tea, soft drinks, eggs, spices, smoked and grilled items, and barbecue charcoal is cheaper than at Walmart. This is a testament to the employee-owned nature of WinCo Foods, as they are focused on inexpensive pricing and not driving big profits. 3. Costco Shopping at Costco offers a unique experience compared to Walmart. Location: Throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 627 Known for: Bulk purchases, exclusive items under the Kirkland brand, regional inventory Best things to buy: Frozen foods, lunch items, fresh food, baking, and cooking essentials Buying In Bulk Buying in bulk at Costco can be much less expensive than at Walmart. Costco’s pricing can be better than Walmart&#8217;s in multiple categories if you like to stock up on items simultaneously. It’s widely considered cheaper to purchase fresh food and frozen foods, and even some staples like milk and eggs can be less expensive at Costco. However, when you buy in bulk, Costco shines. Even though you will pay more upfront, you’ll restock less, which makes things like paper towels and toilet paper less expensive than Walmart. 2. Aldi Aldi beats Walmart in price in multiple categories, such as daily food staples. Location: 40 states throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 2,489 Known for: No-frills shopping experience with numerous private-label products Best things to buy: German foods, baking ingredients, basic food staples, pre-cooked frozen foods The German Giant Aldi offers a no-frills grocery shopping experience. Aldi is expected to have close to 3,200 locations by 2028, making it a formidable competitor to Walmart’s grocery business. Compared to Walmart, there is an expectation that you should be able to walk out of Aldi for at least a few dollars less than you would spend at Walmart if you took a list of the same items. Fans of the brand love it for basic food staples like milk and eggs, as well as foreign food items you can’t get at Walmart. 1. Target Target&#8217;s house brands are competitively priced compared to Walmart&#8217;s. Location: Throughout the U.S. Number of locations: 1,978 Known for: High-quality, low-priced items across food, clothing, beauty, and more Best things to buy: Up &amp; Up cleaning products, deal-worthy essentials Walmart’s Biggest Competitor Target is consistently looking to beat Walmart&#8217;s pricing. When you think of Walmart and competition, it goes without saying that Target is at the very top of the list. While Walmart is generally considered the less expensive of the two, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of items where Target beats Walmart, including bottled water and house-branded cleaning supplies. In many cases, Target’s Cat &amp; Jack brand also offers better pricing for kids’ clothing.

In addition to being one of the largest retailers in the world, Costco is also the most popular location to purchase just about anything in bulk, from peanut butter to clothes. Key Points If you are a true die-hard Costco brand fan, you’ll visit all of these locations in your lifetime. There is something truly special about visiting a Costco with a sinkhole in its parking lot. One Costco has a soccer field built on the building so that you can shop and play on the same day. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) From the start, Costco stands out thanks to its outstanding food court, samples, rotisserie chicken, Kirkland-branded everything, and cheap gas prices. It’s hard to argue that Costco is anything but special. Of course, this begs the question of which Costco stores must be visited in 2025 if you are truly a fan of this brand. 10. South San Francisco Location: South Airport Boulevard Store size: 170,000 square feet Highlights: Unusually large selection of tech gadgets and electronics, health and wellness center Store hours: 9:00 AM – 7:00 PM Electronics Everywhere Located in Silicon Valley, the heart of America’s tech heartbeat, Costco’s South Airport Boulevard location in San Francisco strongly emphasizes gadgets.

Tiquilla, Mexico Location: Tiquilla, Mexico Store size: 175,000 square feet Highlights: Mexico-inspired foot court with plenty of local flavor and a terrific seafood collection Store hours: 10:00 AM – 8:30 PM Mexican Food Court It’s tough to say no to the Tiquilla, Mexico Costco food court as soon as you walk into the store. You should go to this store hungry to enjoy the local Mexican cuisines that populate the food court to promote local flavors. Better yet, this Costco location is super supportive of the local community, which is very important to Mexican culture, making it a staple of the community. 8. Vive La France Location: Villebon-sur-Yvette, France Store size: 160,000 square feet Highlights: More cheese than you could ever hope to find in one Costco store Store hours: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM Wine And Cheese While wine and cheese are undoubtedly plentiful all over France, you’ll be hard pressed to find a single retailer near this Costco location outside Paris with a more extensive wine and cheese aisle.

In other words, visiting this French location will be truly mouth-watering, leaving you with an empty wallet. 7.

Merida, Mexico Location: Merida, Mexico Store size: 150,000 square feet Highlights: Includes a natural sinkhole or cenote in the parking lot Store hours: 9:30 AM – 9:00 PM Discover Nature In Merida One of the more unusual aspects of a Costco location occurs in Merida, Mexico, where a natural cenote is found in the parking lot. Created by the “Chicxulub Crater,” this sinkhole is right there, illuminated by the parking lot at night. Thankfully, even after the Costco closes, visitors can visit this natural phenomenon anytime. What’s crazy about this crater is that while it was formed millions of years ago, it was only discovered in 2015, making it a relatively new discovery for Mexico. 5. Salt Lake City Location: Salt Lake City, Utah Store size: 235,000 square feet Highlights: The largest Costco location in the world and a business center Store hours: 8:00 AM – 8:30 PM Costco Giant Whereas most Costco locations are only around 150,000 square feet, the Salt Lake City Costco location is approximately 235,000 square feet, which makes it the largest in the world. If you walked the entire perimeter of the store, you would walk approximately one-third of a mile. It’s said that employees who work in this store average around 10 miles of walking per day. As a bonus, this store also has one of the biggest walk-in refrigerator sections you can find at any Costco location worldwide. 4. South Korea Prison Turned Costco Location: Gocheok, South Korea Store size: 150,000 square feet Highlights: This Costco location used to be the home of a prison Store hours: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM Prison Turned Costco Before this Costco location turned up in Gocheok, South Korea, it was a former prison. Not only is this South Korea’s largest Costco location, but it was also the home of the Yeongdeungpo prison, which was redeveloped and repurposed into the current Costco location. Interestingly enough, this was also the first Costco location to be placed in a store rather than a stand-alone building. 3. Mexico City Location: Mexico City, Mexico Store size: 150,000 square feet Highlights: Located underneath a park Store hours: 10:00 AM – 8:30 PM It’s A Park And Costco Designed to blend into the local environment, this Costco is well worth visiting to see how it’s set underneath a park. On top of the store’s roof, parking garage, and loading bay is a giant park and play area including a soccer field, walking trails, and a skate park. The store’s designer, Maribel Barba, specifically states it was built to “be hidden and merge with the natural landscape.” 2. Alaska Capital Smallest Costco Location Location: Juneau, Alaska Store size: ~square feet Highlights: Smallest Costco in the world, sells vital resources for the local community Store hours: 9:00 AM – 8:30 PM Smallest Costco Location At only 76,696 square feet, the world’s smallest Costco is almost half the size of the company’s traditional 150,000 square feet locations. However, it’s tough to argue why this Costco ranks as one of the best in the world as it’s vitally important to the community. Due to Juneau’s limited access to the rest of the United States, it brings necessary resources to help residents survive the harsh Alaskan climate. 1. Iwilei Costco Location: Oahu, Hawaii Store size: ~150,000 square feet Highlights: Busiest Costco in the world Store hours: 9:00 AM – 8:30 PM World’s Busiest Costco Currently regarded as the world’s busiest Costco location, revenue from this location is twice that of other Costco stores. In fact, this Costco is so popular and so busy that it’s said that one out of every four island residents have a membership. What’s also incredible about this location is that it achieves these sales numbers even as it’s not the only Costco on the island. If nothing else, visiting this Costco and ordering a $1.50 hot dog is a right of passage for the most die-hard brand fans.

COST,2025-03-04 11:09:09,The 3 Best ETFs to Buy in March,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-3-best-etfs-to-buy-in-march-20250304.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"If you want to invest your money in stocks but do not know how to pick the right stocks, you are not alone. Many retail investors have the money but are not sure how to get started in the stock market. With thousands of companies and stocks to choose from, it is natural to get confused. Fortunately, there are exchange-traded funds or ETFs that can help you with the task. These funds invest in individual stocks and help achieve diversification. All you need to do is choose an ETF that works with your risk appetite and investment goals. Growing market volatility has led several investors towards ETFs and the global ETF industry saw an inflow of $1.45 trillion in 2024. If you are ready to invest in ETFs, here are three ETFs to buy in March. Key points in this article: Investors are playing safe and looking for ETFs to park their money. Besides providing immediate diversification, ETFs also generate steady returns. If you are looking for individual stocks instead of an ETF, get your hands on our “The Next Nvidia” stocks, it has one stock with 10X potential. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF If you want a safe way to ride the stock market, consider the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). With a low expense ratio, it is one of the best ways to invest in the top U.S. companies. As of writing, VOO is trading at $546 and is close to the 52-week high of $563. It has generated 15% returns in a year and over 100% returns in five years. It holds 505 stocks and allocates 30% of the funds into the information technology sector, followed by 14% in the financial sector and 11% in the consumer discretionary industry. One good reason to invest in the ETF is that it follows the S&amp;P 500 and you will be able to own a piece of the top companies without having to pick them individually. Some of the fund’s top holdings include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), the four stalwarts leading the tech industry. It has an expense ratio of only 0.03% and the Assets Under Management are $498.5 billion. While it offers diversification to your portfolio, it is heavily dependent on the tech industry for majority gains. Hence, if you are optimistic about the growth of the tech sector, this is an ideal ETF to own. As long as the tech sector continues to post gains, VOO will keep soaring. Invesco QQQ The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is ideal for investors who want higher exposure to the tech sector. It follows the Nasdaq 100 and has an expense ratio of 0.15%. At the time of writing, QQQ is up 14% in the year and 146% in the past five years. Its NAV is $508 and is lower than the 52-week high of $540. Since its launch in 1999, the fund has shown strong performance and generated +443.43% higher returns than the S&amp;P 500. The Assets Under Management (AUM) of the fund is $171.86 billion. QQQ offers high exposure to the Magnificent Seven and allows you to own some of the most popular stocks. Its biggest holdings include Microsoft Corporation, Apple Inc., and NVIDIA, the three tech giants driving the market today. Over 50% of the fund’s holdings are in the tech sector followed by the consumer discretionary. Notably, the fund also owns stocks in different industries and has some long-term winners like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST). The solid diversification of the fund ensures that it stands strong when volatility hits the tech industry. Invesco QQQ is ideal for low-risk investors who seek steady growth and steady income. While it offers exposure to the technology sector, it maintains a strong balance in its total holdings. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF Cathie Wood’s ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NASDAQ: ARKF) focuses on companies that are transforming the financial sector through digital assets, blockchain, and mobile payments. It has an expense ratio of 0.75% and an NAV of $38.07. The fund has generated 31% returns in the year and 54% in the past five years. I believe the fintech industry is going through a solid transition and some of the biggest companies like Coinbase and Shopify will lead the change. There is optimism about the future of fintech and this ETF will help investors make the most of it. The fund allocation includes 39% in the technology sector followed by 28% in the financial services sector and 18% in communication services. The fund’s top three holdings include Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), Coinbase Global Inc (COIN), and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD). These three stocks are on a rally and have impressed the market with stellar financials. However, there is one risk associated with the ETF, if the financial sector falls, the returns will drop. However, the current situation suggests that the fintech sector is poised for growth. The fund has a low NAV, making it a strong buy at the current level. It is down from the 52-week high of $44. If you are someone who follows Cathie Wood’s investment decisions and is optimistic about the financial sector, this ETF is an exciting buy for the month.

COST announced plans to replace PepsiCo Inc. PEP with Coca-Cola Co KO as its food court beverage supplier, marking a significant shift in the retail giant’s strategy and highlighting Coca-Cola’s growing market momentum. What Happened: The change, announced by Costco CEO Ron Vachris at the company’s annual shareholders meeting, will take effect this summer, returning Coca-Cola products to Costco’s food courts after a decade-long absence. ""We will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola,"" Vachris said, according to CNN. The move comes as Coca-Cola demonstrates strong growth potential, particularly in emerging markets. The beverage contract, which includes fountain drinks, cups, and straws, has been held by PepsiCo since 2013. The switch back to Coca-Cola coincides with analysts’ bullish outlook on the beverage maker. See Also: Trump Is About To Make Americans Pay Even More For Coffee To Punish Colombia, Says AOC: He Is All About Making Inflation ‘Worse’ Why It Matters: Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery recently initiated coverage of Coca-Cola with an “Overweight” rating and a $74 price target, citing the company’s strong position in North America and Latin America, which contribute approximately 70% of its operating income. The transition aligns with Costco’s commitment to maintaining its iconic $1.50 hot dog and soda combination, a loss-leader that sold approximately 150 million units last year. This pricing strategy, unchanged since 1985, remains central to Costco’s customer value proposition, despite inflationary pressures affecting other food court items. Coca-Cola’s return to Costco’s food courts could further strengthen its market position. The company’s significant exposure to emerging markets, where roughly 68% of the population doesn’t consume commercial beverages, represents a growth opportunity of about 4.5 times its current consumer base, according to Piper Sandler’s analysis.",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/25/01/43220199/costco-ditches-pepsi-for-coca-cola-in-major-food-court-supplier-switch-reinforces-1-50-hot-dog-c

Rest assured that Costco’s competitors are everywhere, and many specifically target its pricing and selection to win new customers over. Key Points While Costco might be the most popular bulk shopping location, it’s not the only one. Sam’s Club and BJ’s are both looking to steal Costco’s market share. Walmart and Target also have great deals on bulk items, especially online. Also: Discover “The Next NVIDIA” When you think about Costco, you think about electronics, televisions, samples, bulk toilet paper, bulk vitamins, and more. For most people, buying in bulk is all about saving, but the reality is that this feeling isn’t something you can only find at Costco but at numerous other retailers as well. 10. Albertsons Locations: 2,271 Known for: Locally grown produce, specialty meats, fresh fish, lots of cheese Best things to buy: The Albertson’s selection of cheese is second to none The Cheese Superstore Known for its large assortment of cheeses, Albertsons offers any number of bulk shopping items. Its selection doesn’t quite match Costco’s, but its prices sure do, and with a higher quality standard as well. Among its bulk specialties, Albertson’s excels with a meat and seafood selection, frozen foods, baby care, personal care, and cleaning and home products. Of course, don’t forget all the bulk cookies and snacks you hope to buy in one purchase. 9. Staples Locations: 994 Known for: Being a one-stop shop for office products Best things to buy: Office products, printers, chairs, computers The Office Superstore If you’re looking for an office superstore where you can bulk buy everything from staplers to printer paper, you can find it all at Staples. While Costco isn’t an office supply store, it does have the most common items you would find that Staples carries for far less. Staples is the best place for writing supplies, office basics, folders &amp; filing, desk organizers, and many storage and organization items. 8. AllBulkFoods Locations: 0 Known for: Buying everything in bulk, being online only Best things to buy: Baking, cooking products, candy, chocolate, nuts, organic snacks Dedicated Bulk Seller Relatively unknown to other names, AllBulkFoods is one of the best destinations for bulk everything. The company is proud to sell products by the “inner-pack, case, pallet, and a truckload” if that’s what everyone would like. The company makes a big sticking point that it’s an ideal shopping solution for weddings, family gatherings, holiday get-togethers, or just having friends who love to shop and enjoy a ton of bulk candy. 7. Amazon Locations: 0 Known for: A one-stop shop for everything in your life across any variety of products Best things to buy: Bulk everything like toilet paper, plasticware, food The Online Giant While it doesn’t have a physical presence with its bulk items, it’s hard to ignore just how many items you can buy in bulk on Amazon. When it comes to something like toilet paper, the sheer selection of bulk options you have is incredible. Do you need 90 or 108 toilet paper rolls in a single order? How about 360 plastic spoons? You can grab those on Amazon, too, with two-day delivery at a price that’s less than Costco. 6. Dollar Tree Locations: 15,288 Known for: Being an inexpensive variety discount store that operates in 48 states and Canada Best things to buy: Frozen foods, milk, eggs, pizza, ice cream One Dollar Goodness Dollar Tree is one of the best-known dollar stores in the country, famous for its variety of products. You can find almost anything at Dollar Tree, from private-label brands to food, dinnerware, glassware, snacks, party decorations, and more. This store is unique because you aren’t necessarily buying bulk items, but you can buy in bulk and spend less than you would at a store like Costco. 5. Winco Locations: 138 Known for: Being privately owned by employees as a no-frills warehouse-style Best things to buy: Groceries, bulk food Bulk Food Grocery The least-known name on this list, Winco Foods, is famous for being a bulk food destination. The family-style employee-owned grocery store offers a giant selection of bulk food items that would impress even the most die-hard Costco customer. Best of all, Winco has some of the best prices on dry and canned goods you can’t find anywhere else. Winco hopes to continue expanding into other markets so it can bring its bulk shopping selection to other states. 4. Target Locations: 1,956 Known for: Quality clothing, big electronics section, household goods, bedding, kitchen Best things to buy: Groceries, kids clothing, bulk items like toilet paper Bulky Bullseye Like Walmart, you might not think of Target in the same light as Costco for bulk purchases, but Target wants you to believe otherwise. This is especially true for bulk items in the household essentials category. Target is full of bulk laundry care products, Clorox wipes, trash bags, and more rolls of bulk toilet paper than you ever truly need to purchase at once. You can save 5% on every Target RedCard purchase, and no membership fee is required. 3. Walmart Locations: 10,586 Known for: Low-priced shopping, being a one-stop shop for everything in your life Best things to buy: Groceries, clothes, electronics, healthcare, medicine Big Bulk Section It’s okay if you don’t think of Walmart as a big bulk store similar to Costco, but Walmart is here to prove you wrong. Walmart’s website has an entire section dedicated to its bulk items, including hundreds of food items with significantly larger packaging that you would otherwise normally buy at Walmart. This includes bulk granola bars, pasta, rice, snacks, candy, chicken, chocolate, and more. 2. BJ’s Locations: 266 Known for: Saving up to 25% on groceries compared to traditional supermarket Best things to buy: Home decor, toys, electronics, groceries The Wholesale Club Touting the idea that you can save up to 25% on groceries compared to a traditional grocer, BJ’s makes a compelling argument over Costco. Better yet, you have the Wellsley Farms and Berkely Jensen brands, which not only rival Costco’s beloved Kirkland brand but, in many ways, beat it on price. Fill your cart with bulk deals at BJ’s and then use ExpressPay to scan products through a mobile pay and skip the checkout line. 1. Sam’s Club Locations: 599 Known for: Bulk items, low prices, no-frills shopping Best things to buy: Groceries, electronics, toilet paper, paper towels, medicine The “Other” Costco Walmart’s “Other” Location Widely considered Costco’s biggest competitor, Sam’s Club is widely known for its outstanding prices and benefits. Not only does Sam’s Club generally have a less expensive membership cost, but members of both clubs often rave about Sam’s Club discounts on beef, chicken, and alcohol, as well as having some name brands that Costco doesn’t offer in favor of its Kirkland branding.

Other retailers go out of their way to drop pricing below that of Walmart. Some of the best pricing can be found at regional grocers. Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold Forever When it comes to value pricing in the retail segment in the United States, there is a consistent belief that Walmart offers the best bang for your buck. While Amazon has certainly made a dent in Walmart with online sales, as far as physical stores go, the belief that Walmart is the least expensive isn’t always true. In many cases, other retail chains that compete with Walmart look at its pricing as the line in the sand. Said differently, plenty of competitors shop at Walmart and then determine in what categories they can beat Walmart’s pricing to attract customers to their stores. 8. Market Basket More In Your Basket Market Basket offers a lot of value for its customer base. Locations: 90 Known for: Being one of the least expensive groceries in the New England area with a “more for your dollar” slogan Best things to buy: New England fish items like clams, fresh seafood, maple syrup, pears, apples More In Your Basket There is something special about Market Basket pricing. According to a recent study, Market Basket’s pricing was 18% lower than other Boston-area groceries. This study found that a family spending $250 per week on groceries could save as much as $2,300 annually by shopping at Market Basket. The privately owned business heavily focuses on keeping prices down, which has helped Market Basket earn a reputation as one of the cheapest groceries in the US. 7. Food 4 Less Food 4 Less is more than living up to its name. Locations: 101 Known for: A no-frills grocery store where customers bag their groceries Best things to buy: Organic orange juice, cage-free brown eggs, vegetable chips, and organic creamy peanut butter A Kroger Brand Food 4 Less is backed by its parent company, Kroger. Located in just four states, the Kroger-owned Food 4 Less brand is quickly becoming a go-to choice for customers looking for inexpensive groceries. These locations sell dry goods, canned goods, baking supplies, and organic and non-organic produce for less. The same can be said for health and beauty items, though Walmart has a larger selection overall. 6. H-E-B H-E-B is a bonafide Texas staple. Locations: 420 Known for: Being region-specific to just Texas, with 380 stores in Texas and another few dozen in Mexico Best things to buy: Whataburger sauces, Texas-branded products, Taste of San Antonio, fajitas, tortillas, and more Better In Texas H-E-B offers food items you can’t find at your local Walmart. As Texans believe everything is better in Texas, this might be true if you shop at a H-E-B grocery store. Considered one of the best privately owned groceries in the country, H-E-B pricing compares very well to Walmart while offering things you can’t get at any Walmart location. However, where H-E-B truly wins is its low-priced yet outstanding quality meats and produce, which Walmart cannot match. 5. Lidl Lidl is attempting to enter the US market. Locations: 173 Known for: Fantastic selection of low-price items, including store-branded items, which account for 80% of the store’s inventory Best things to buy: Seafood and dairy, organic meats, organic fruits and vegetables, dairy products and fair-trade chocolates Store Branded Everything With its competitive pricing, Lidl will grow quickly in the US. Another international brand trying to carve out a niche in the United States, Lidl, is already well on its way to success. With 173 stores and growing, where Lidl beats out Walmart is the idea that over 80% of the items in Lidl stores are store-branded items. This means they are cheaper than brand-name items and even cheaper than Walmart’s private-label brands. Ultimately, Lidl is cheaper and healthier with grass-fed meats, organic fruits and vegetables, and organic dairy products. 4. WinCo Foods WinCo Foods is a surprisingly delightful place to shop due to its pricing. Locations: 141 Known for: Midwest-based employee-owned grocery store with more than 20,000 employees Best things to buy: Boxed foods, dairy products, and bulk chases are said to save customers a lot of money The Midwest Surprise You won’t be disappointed with the price when you enter WinCo Foods. With only 141 employee-owned locations in the Midwest, many Americans can’t walk into a WinCo Foods store. However, for those who can, the bulk purchase area in its stores can be vastly cheaper than Walmart. Everything from Arizona Iced Tea, soft drinks, eggs, spices, smoked and grilled items, and barbecue charcoal is cheaper than Walmart. This is a testament to the employee-owned nature of WinCo Foods, as they are focused on inexpensive pricing and not driving big profits. 3. Costco Shopping at Costco offers a unique experience compared to Walmart. Locations: 890 Known for: Bulk purchases, exclusive items under the Kirkland brand, regional inventory Best things to buy: Frozen foods, lunch items, fresh food, baking and cooking essentials Buying In Bulk Buying in bulk at Costco can be much less expensive than at Walmart. Costco’s pricing can be better than Walmart’s in multiple categories if you like to stock up on items simultaneously. It’s widely considered cheaper to purchase fresh food and frozen foods, and even some staples like milk and eggs can be less expensive at Costco. However, when you buy in bulk, Costco shines. Even though you will pay more upfront, you’ll restock less, which makes things like paper towels and toilet paper less expensive than Walmart. 2. Aldi Aldi beats Walmart in price in multiple categories, such as daily food staples. Locations: 2,443 Known for: No-frills shopping experience with numerous private-label products Best things to buy: German foods, baking ingredients, basic food staples, pre-cooked frozen foods The German Giant Aldi offers a no-frills grocery shopping experience. Aldi is expected to have close to 3,200 locations by 2028, making it a formidable competitor to Walmart’s grocery business. Compared to Walmart, there is an expectation you should be able to walk out of Aldi for at least a few dollars less than you would spend at Walmart if you took a list of the same items. Fans of the brand love it for basic food staples like milk and eggs, as well as foreign food items you can’t get at Walmart. 1. Target Target’s house brands are competitively priced compared to Walmart. Locations: 1,963 Known for: High-quality, low-priced items across food, clothing, beauty, and more Best things to buy: Up &amp; Up cleaning products, dealworthy essentials Walmart’s Biggest Competitor Target is consistently looking to beat Walmart’s pricing. When you think of Walmart and competition, it goes without saying that Target is at the very top of the competition. While Walmart is generally considered the less expensive of the two, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of items where Target beats Walmart, including bottled water and house-branded cleaning supplies. In many cases, Target’s Cat &amp; Jack brand also offers better pricing for kids’ clothing.
