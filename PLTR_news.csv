However, the software company&#8217;s better-than-expected first-quarter report gave the stock a boost last month. The share price is now 27.9% higher than at the beginning of the year. Compared to a year ago, the stock is 395.0% higher, far outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq in that time. Since the company went public in 2021, its stock price is up 613.9%. So, this has clearly been a top growth stock that investors have done well owning in recent years. AppLovin has been among the top tech stocks seeing a lot of love from the market, but is that still true with the recent overhang? 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) has seen incredibly strong growth, driven by its core business model that helps online advertisers boost monetization and marketing efforts for their solutions. Key drivers propelling AppLovin going forward include its enhancements in AI-powered advertising and its expansion into e-commerce advertising. Here’s where this stock has come since its inception, and where AppLovin could be headed over the next few years. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. These days, the company focuses on providing software solutions that enhance the marketing and monetization of online advertisers. With AppLovin, there are certainly catalysts worth considering, and we&#8217;ll get to those shortly. It continues to benefit from the strong secular growth trends investors are seeking increased exposure to. As investors continue to pile into such stocks, retail investors appear eager to gain outsized exposure ahead of a continued boom. It is worth remembering that AppLovin did experience a drawdown of more than 90% from its post-pandemic highs in 2021. So, is this stock headed for a further beatdown, or is its momentum real? Let&#8217;s dive into some catalysts and price predictions around where this stock could go for the rest of 2025 through to the end of this decade. Three Key Drivers for AppLovin As mentioned, AppLovin investors have to contend with plenty of news. For instance, the analysts covering AppLovin have not been as bullish on this company as many may think, having issued warnings on the stock in the past year or so due to concerns around the company&#8217;s fundamentals. Nonetheless, we see these key drivers propelling AppLovin going forward. 1. AI-Powered Advertising Enhancements AppLovin’s Axon AI engine has been a game-changer, optimizing ad targeting and expanding beyond gaming into new categories like e-commerce, fintech, and automotive advertising. During the Q4 2024 earnings call, CEO Adam Foroughi highlighted that for the first time, AppLovin captured a significant share of holiday shopping ad spend—validating that its AI models are effective outside gaming. Scaling AI Beyond Gaming: The company initially focused on direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands, but early pilots have shown AI-driven success across multiple verticals. This means any business in any industry could potentially tap into AppLovin’s advertising platform. Personalized Advertising With Generative AI: The company is developing automated tools and AI-generated ad creatives to improve engagement. AppLovin’s self-service platform (currently in development) will eventually allow businesses to run ads autonomously with AI-optimized targeting—a major step toward scaling its reach. AppLovin&#8217;s AI capabilities are proving to be industry-agnostic, opening the door for millions of global advertisers. 2. Expansion Into E-Commerce Advertising Foroughi described fourth-quarter 2024 as a major milestone, marking AppLovin’s first real penetration into e-commerce advertising. Historically, the company primarily monetized mobile gaming ads, but now retail and consumer brands are joining the platform in large numbers. Surging Demand From E-Commerce Brands: Advertisers saw strong return on investment during the holiday season, prompting continued demand for the platform in 2025. Pilot Program Scaling Up: While AppLovin hasn’t disclosed the number of e-commerce advertisers, industry checks suggest a significant influx of brands wanting access. Self-Service Expansion Is the Next Big Growth Driver: Currently, the company manually onboards advertisers, but in 2025, the launch of automated tools and a self-serve platform will allow thousands of new businesses to join. E-commerce advertising is set to be a major revenue contributor. Once self-serve tools become operational, adoption could scale exponentially. 3. Strategic Divestment of Mobile Gaming Unit AppLovin is officially exiting game development—a move that frees up resources to focus entirely on advertising technology. $900 Million Sale of Apps Business: AppLovin announced that it has signed an exclusive term sheet to sell its mobile gaming division, with $500 million in cash and $400 million in equity in a private company. Why This Matters: The company originally acquired gaming studios to train its AI models, but it was never meant to be a core business. Now that AI is self-sufficient, AppLovin no longer needs to develop its own games. Shifting to a Pure Ad-Tech Model: With gaming divested, the company can fully concentrate on expanding its advertising ecosystem—positioning itself as a direct competitor to Google and Meta in the ad tech space. Divesting from mobile games is a giant pivot for the stock, as it paves the way as a pure advertising technology company. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 There are clearly strong reasons why AppLovin was up as much as it is this year. Simply put, investors have been banking on AppLovin as a potential AI beneficiary, as several AI advancements have fueled customer success and accelerated the company&#8217;s adoption and growth rates across the board. If the company can continue to prioritize generating outsized free cash flow and return capital to shareholders to a greater degree, I certainly think this multiple could be warranted. Here&#8217;s where the stock could be headed, assuming the company&#8217;s multiple stays the same and earnings grow according to analyst estimates. Wall Street&#8217;s consensus one-year price target for AppLovin has risen to $457.67, which would be a 10.5% gain from the current price. On average, 27 analysts covering AppLovin recommend buying shares, four of them with a Strong Buy rating. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s forecast projects AppLovin&#8217;s stock price to be just $377.10 by year&#8217;s end, or about 9% lower than today&#8217;s price. Yet, we see the stock continuing its strong growth rate and outperforming analysts&#8217; expectations going forward. AppLovin Price Target for 2030 By the end of the decade, we estimate AppLovin’s stock price to be $662.40 per share with less than 10% year-over-year revenue growth. Our estimated stock price will be nearly 60% higher than the current stock price. Year Price Target Upside Potential 2025 $377.10 −8.9% 2026 $445.78 7.6% 2027 $500.47 20.8% 2028 $572.02 38.1% 2029 $609.44 47.2% 2030 $662.40 59.9% Palantir Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 The post AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 (May 30) appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/forecasts/2025/06/06/applovin-price-prediction-and-forecast-2025-2030/

Year-to-date, the stock is up an eye-catching 74.53%, and over the past year, it has gained an absurd 495%. While the stock&#8217;s forward P/E ratio — currently 238.10 — can be concerning, Palantir&#8217;s federal contracts and aerospace ties are expected to continue fueling growth. While earnings are rear-facing, the emerging trends seen in the company&#8217;s Q1 results can serve as a foundation for further rewards for shareholders. In the first quarter, Palantir saw year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. U.S. commercial business surpassed a $1 billion run rate, good for 71% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year. PLTR&#8217;s market multiple implies it could take an investor nearly half a century to recover their initial investment, assuming earnings remained constant. But the assumption from the company — and from Wall Street analysts — is that earnings will continue to grow. EPS in Q1 2024, for example, stood at 8 cents, while EPS in Q1 2025 rose to 13 cents, good for an increase of 62.5%. So while there is concern about its valuation, what can investors expect from Palantir over the next year? 24/7 Wall St. did some analysis, so let’s take a look at. Key Points in This Article: Palantir&#8217;s government line of business accounts for more than half of its revenue, with existing contracts between the AI firm and the U.S. Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Agriculture, the FBI, the CDC, the U.S. Army and the UK&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, to name a handful. The company&#8217;s explosive commercial revenue growth shows that it is capable of sustainably scaling without being overly reliant upon federal contracts. It also provides services to numerous industries, including energy, data protection, health and life sciences, insurance, hospital operations, retail, semiconductors, telecommunications and utilities, among others. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Palantir? The AI environment is ripe for growth, though, of which Palantir should play a major part. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $1.811 trillion by the end of the decade, good for a 35.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2025 and 2030. The global market size of AI in 2024 was $279.2 billion, meaning at that forecasted CAGR, by the end of 2025, the market should expand to $379.4 billion. Companies like Palantir that focus on broad AI applications in diverse industries should see the lion&#8217;s share of that growth. This industry growth potential is one reason Palantir provided strong guidance in its Q1 earnings call, stating that it expects 36% revenue growth, with free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Not only has the company seen sizable growth, it forecasts sustainable momentum that will help continue that pattern over the course of the next year. Palantir’s government segment, which contributes 55% of revenue, grew 45% year-over-year in Q1 2025 to $373 million. High-profile contracts, like the recently signed ICE deal and NATO’s adoption of its AI-enabled military system, highlight its critical role in national security. President Trump&#8217;s emphasis on defense and government efficiency, exemplified by the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, positions Palantir as a go-to AI software provider, boosting investor confidence amid tariff-related market challenges. Additionally, the company&#8217;s commercial segment has skyrocketed, with U.S. commercial revenue up 71% year-over-year to $255 million in Q1 2025. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, empowers enterprises in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing to harness AI for data analytics. Strategic partnerships and 139 deals worth $1 million or more in Q1 (31 were over $10 million) demonstrate Palantir’s private-sector expansion, helping to drive stock gains. Palantir’s focus on operational efficiency has improved profitability, with adjusted operating margins expanding to 36% in Q1 2025 from 29% in 2024. Its software-as-a-service model, with high-margin recurring revenue, supports scalability across government and commercial clients. The company’s ability to deploy AIP rapidly, as shown by a 69% increase in customer count to 593, enhances revenue predictability. This profitability, coupled with $3.9 billion in cash reserves, fuels R&amp;D and market expansion, reinforcing investor optimism. Palantir (PLTR) as a Stock Since its IPO, Palantir has seen uncommon and exponential share appreciation, rising more than 1,300% since going public on Oct. 2, 2020. An enormous part of that growth came between February 2023 and February 2025, before the market began to correct this year. After reaching its all-time-high on Feb. 18, shares of PLTR fell by more than 40% before bottoming on April 4. But for patient, buy-and-hold investors, they have already been rewarded as the stock has pushed back up and established new all-time highs. Following the company&#8217;s Q1 earnings report, Royal Bank of Canada and Deutsche Bank reiterated their &#8220;Underperform&#8221; and &#8220;Sell&#8221; ratings, respectively, on the AI data analytics firm. Most other analysts, though, maintained their &#8220;Hold&#8221; ratings. A notable exception was Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a PLTR perma-bull who reiterated his buy call, saying Plantar is&#8221;one of our top tech names to own&#8221; and setting a $140 per share price target. Broadly, 18 Wall Street analysts assign the stock a consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating, with three analysts giving it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 11 giving it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and four giving it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. However, price targets for the AI darling represent a vast spread of opinions, with the high-end price target at $140, the median price target at $100.13 and the low-end price target at $40. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $40 -69.69% Median $1o0.13 -24.12% High $150 13.66% Palantir Technologies 2025 Outlook Palantir has made several important announcements over the past few weeks, including a $30 million contract with ICE to develop a system to help with deportations, and a partnership with TWG Global and xAI to bring AI to the financial services industry. That news has driven the stock higher in the short term. But as the broad market&#8217;s outlook remains clouded, so too does Palantir&#8217;s. That is reflected in Wall Street&#8217;s consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. The coming year for Palantir&#8217;s stock performance will continue to be shaped by the contracts it wins, both with the government and the private sector. Analysts project a 35% increase in revenue to $3.88 billion this year, though PLTR raised its guidance to $3.89 billion to $3.9 billion, up from its prior forecast of $3.74 billion to $3.75 billion. Palantir calls for a minimum 68% jump in commercial revenue to $1.178 billion, with CEO Alex Karp saying, &#8220;We are delivering the operating system for the modern enterprise in the era of AI.&#8221; While Palantir does face competition from both large AI Big Data forms, as well as smaller, fast-growing AI data analytics shops, the company can be seen as having an entrenched position within government and large enterprises. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Palantir Technologies is less bearish at $107, which represents 18.92% potential downside from the stock&#8217;s current price. Those figures are based on Palantir having developed the premier AI software, but the decreasing cost of AI and expansion of large language models to lower barriers to entrance in decision-making software. We see projected revenue growth rates moderating over time climb from $3.9 billion in 2025 to $11.9 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $0.58 in 2025 to $1.44 in 2030.

(NASDAQ:PLTR) gained 0.17% on Monday, adding to the its recent rally that has seen the stock gain 6.20% over the past month. Year-to-date, PLTR is up more than 75%. Over the past year, the stock has gained nearly 519%, and since going public in October 2020, the AI firm is up more than 1,334.00%. In late May, the Trump administration rewarded a federal contract worth hundreds of millions to Palantir with the objective of creating a database on every U.S. citizen. On April 21, Investor&#8217;s Business Daily reported that Palantir won an immigration tracking federal contract from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The ICE contract, which is said to be worth $30 million, will be used to create an immigration Lifecycle Operating System to be used in deportations. Earlier in April, the price target for Palantir was lowered by analyst Mark Schappel of Loop Capital to $125 from $141, with the firm maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. However, there is optimism surrounding the AI company, whose strong full-year guidance for 2025 sees a sales forecast between $3.74 billion and $3.76 billion, topping average estimates of $3.52 billion. Big Data is expected to be big business in the years ahead. According to platform provider Edge Delta, the market for data services is projected to grow from $220.2 billion in 2023 to $401.2 billion by 2028 — an increase of 82.2%. Palantir is a major player in the space. The company was co-founded by entrepreneur and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who was also the co-founder of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and the first outside investor in Facebook. The company stands as one of Big Data&#8217;s industry dominators. However, finding data-driven assessments of where the company&#8217;s stock will be in the medium and long term can be complicated. With Wall Street analysts only going as far as providing one-year price targets, it can be difficult for investors to accurately gauge predictions for stocks like these over longer horizons. But for buy-and-hold investors who want to know where Palantir&#8217;s stock might be several years down the road, 24/7 Wall St. has done the legwork and can provide insights around the numbers coming from the company, and which market segments the company is operating in that are most exciting to us. Key Points in This Article: Key growth drivers: Palantir&#8217;s four operating platforms, AIP, Foundry, Gotham and Apollo. The company&#8217;s AI platforms are in high demand from the federal government.

That drop in net income can be easily attributed, though. The company&#8217;s IPO in 2020 raised $2.6 billion, but that was shortly followed by 2022&#8217;s year-long bear market. Nonetheless, by 2023, the Big Data firm was able to reach profitability for the first time in its then 20-year history. The momentum has continued with a series of earnings beats, most recently in March when Palantir reported that in Q1, the company beat on EPS by 1.11% and revenue by 2.52%. That marked the seventh consecutive EPS beat for the company, and the ninth in 10 quarters. Key Drivers of Palantir&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Palantir&#8217;s Expansion and Adoption of AI and Machine Learning Platforms: In addition to its AI bootcamps, the company offers clients four platforms to help manage, analyze, and secure their sensitive data. The first, AIP, focuses on introducing AI into companies&#8217; operations. Foundry, Palantir&#8217;s operating system for modern enterprises, allows customers to harmonize and automate decision-making in complex settings while bridging the divide between core business and operating teams with data teams and modeling teams. Gotham, its third platform, focuses on a global scale, with the company billing the software as the weapons system for decision-making, which has extensive applications in defense and combat. Finally, Palantir&#8217;s Gotham platform is an operating system for continuous delivery with a focus on deployment — that is, integrating a machine-learning model into a production environment. Palantir is also making a strong push into modular sales to attract smaller clients and scale them with customer solutions as they grow. This strategy will significantly expand Palantir&#8217;s customer base and provide years of earnings growth. 2. Government Demand: Palantir&#8217;s revenue from government sources has outperformed revenue from commercial sources each year since 2020, with notable growth every year. In 2023, government-sourced revenue regifted $1.222 billion compared to $1.002 billion for commercially-sourced revenue. The company&#8217;s government clients include the United States Intelligence Community and the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Palantir&#8217;s software as a service (SaaS) is one of only five that are authorized for the DoD&#8217;s Mission Critical National Security Systems. By revenue, the U.S. government is the company&#8217;s largest client, and with ever-growing defense spending as a fixture of the U.S. federal government&#8217;s budget, the relationship is ripe. Bottom line, government demand is still core to Palantir, and with modular sales, the company will pack a double punch of private and public. 3. Space Partnerships: On June 27, 2024, Palantir signed a strategic partnership with Voyager Space with the aim of leveraging its AI intelligence to drive innovation in space technology. According to its press release, Voyager will now fully integrate Palantir&#8217;s AI capabilities into its defense solutions, enhancing communications, military research and development, and bolstering intelligence and space research with the end goal of making space more accessible to the defense community. Voyager will be using Palantir&#8217;s Foundry platform. This marks the second strategic space partnership for the company, which also signed an agreement with Starlab Space on June 20, 2024. In this deal, Palantir became the exclusive supplier of enterprise-wide software data management solutions for the Starlab commercial space station — a planned low Earth orbit venture that is expected to launch no later than 2028 and is a joint venture between Starlab and Airbus. Palantir (PLTR) Stock Prediction in 2025 According to Wall Street analysts, the current median one-year price target for Palantir’s stock is $100.13, which represents potential downside of 24.11% from today&#8217;s share price.

PLTR,2025-05-28 14:06:21,Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/palantir-technologies-nasdaq-pltr-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-20250528.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) slipped 0.34% over the past five trading sessions. That followed a sell-off after the company reported Q1 earnings on May 5. Still, the stock is up 8.90% over the past month and has gained more than 66% year-to-date. While the stock&#8217;s forward P/E ratio — currently 222.22 — can be concerning, Palantir&#8217;s federal contracts and aerospace ties are expected to continue fueling growth. While earnings are rear-facing, the emerging trends seen in the company&#8217;s Q1 results can serve as a foundation for further rewards for shareholders. In the first quarter, Palantir saw year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. U.S. commercial business surpassed a $1 billion run rate, good for 71% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year. PLTR&#8217;s market multiple implies it could take an investor nearly half a century to recover their initial investment, assuming earnings remained constant. But the assumption from the company — and from Wall Street analysts — is that earnings will continue to grow. EPS in Q1 2024, for example, stood at 8 cents, while EPS in Q1 2025 rose to 13 cents, good for an increase of 62.5%. So while there is concern about its valuation, what can investors expect from Palantir over the next year? 24/7 Wall St. did some analysis, so let’s take a look at. Key Points in This Article: Palantir&#8217;s government line of business accounts for more than half of its revenue, with existing contracts between the AI firm and the U.S. Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Agriculture, the FBI, the CDC, the U.S. Army and the UK&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, to name a handful. The company&#8217;s explosive commercial revenue growth shows that it is capable of sustainably scaling without being overly reliant upon federal contracts. It also provides services to numerous industries, including energy, data protection, health and life sciences, insurance, hospital operations, retail, semiconductors, telecommunications and utilities, among others.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Palantir? The AI environment is ripe for growth, though, of which Palantir should play a major part. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $1.811 trillion by the end of the decade, good for a 35.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2025 and 2030. The global market size of AI in 2024 was $279.2 billion, meaning at that forecasted CAGR, by the end of 2025, the market should expand to $379.4 billion. Companies like Palantir that focus on broad AI applications in diverse industries should see the lion&#8217;s share of that growth. This industry growth potential is one reason Palantir provided strong guidance in its Q1 earnings call, stating that it expects 36% revenue growth, with free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Not only has the company seen sizable growth, it forecasts sustainable momentum that will help continue that pattern over the course of the next year. Palantir’s government segment, which contributes 55% of revenue, grew 45% year-over-year in Q1 2025 to $373 million. High-profile contracts, like the recently signed ICE deal and NATO’s adoption of its AI-enabled military system, highlight its critical role in national security. President Trump&#8217;s emphasis on defense and government efficiency, exemplified by the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, positions Palantir as a go-to AI software provider, boosting investor confidence amid tariff-related market challenges. Additionally, the company&#8217;s commercial segment has skyrocketed, with U.S. commercial revenue up 71% year-over-year to $255 million in Q1 2025. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, empowers enterprises in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing to harness AI for data analytics. Strategic partnerships and 139 deals worth $1 million or more in Q1 (31 were over $10 million) demonstrate Palantir’s private-sector expansion, helping to drive stock gains. Palantir’s focus on operational efficiency has improved profitability, with adjusted operating margins expanding to 36% in Q1 2025 from 29% in 2024. Its software-as-a-service model, with high-margin recurring revenue, supports scalability across government and commercial clients. The company’s ability to deploy AIP rapidly, as shown by a 69% increase in customer count to 593, enhances revenue predictability. This profitability, coupled with $3.9 billion in cash reserves, fuels R&amp;D and market expansion, reinforcing investor optimism. Palantir (PLTR) as a Stock Since its IPO, Palantir has seen uncommon and exponential share appreciation, rising more than 1,300% since going public on Oct. 2, 2020. An enormous part of that growth came between February 2023 and February 2025, before the market began to correct this year. After reaching its all-time-high on Feb. 18, shares of PLTR fell by more than 40% before bottoming on April 4. But for patient, buy-and-hold investors, they have already been rewarded as the stock has pushed back up and established new all-time highs. Following the company&#8217;s Q1 earnings report, Royal Bank of Canada and Deutsche Bank reiterated their &#8220;Underperform&#8221; and &#8220;Sell&#8221; ratings, respectively, on the AI data analytics firm. Most other analysts, though, maintained their &#8220;Hold&#8221; ratings. A notable exception was Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a PLTR perma-bull who reiterated his buy call, saying Plantar is&#8221;one of our top tech names to own&#8221; and setting a $140 per share price target. Broadly, 18 Wall Street analysts assign the stock a consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating, with three analysts giving it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 11 giving it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and four giving it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. However, price targets for the AI darling represent a vast spread of opinions, with the high-end price target at $140, the median price target at $100.13 and the low-end price target at $40. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $40 -67.95% Median $1o0.13 -19.77% High $150 20.18% Palantir Technologies 2025 Outlook Palantir has made several important announcements over the past few weeks, including a $30 million contract with ICE to develop a system to help with deportations, and a partnership with TWG Global and xAI to bring AI to the financial services industry. That news has driven the stock higher in the short term. But as the broad market&#8217;s outlook remains clouded, so too does Palantir&#8217;s. That is reflected in Wall Street&#8217;s consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. The coming year for Palantir&#8217;s stock performance will continue to be shaped by the contracts it wins, both with the government and the private sector. Analysts project a 35% increase in revenue to $3.88 billion this year, though PLTR raised its guidance to $3.89 billion to $3.9 billion, up from its prior forecast of $3.74 billion to $3.75 billion. Palantir calls for a minimum 68% jump in commercial revenue to $1.178 billion, with CEO Alex Karp saying, &#8220;We are delivering the operating system for the modern enterprise in the era of AI.&#8221; While Palantir does face competition from both large AI Big Data forms, as well as smaller, fast-growing AI data analytics shops, the company can be seen as having an entrenched position within government and large enterprises. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Palantir Technologies is less bearish at $107, which represents 14.26% potential downside from the stock&#8217;s current price. Those figures are based on Palantir having developed the premier AI software, but the decreasing cost of AI and expansion of large language models to lower barriers to entrance in decision-making software. We see projected revenue growth rates moderating over time climb from $3.9 billion in 2025 to $11.9 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $0.58 in 2025 to $1.44 in 2030.

Both stocks have rallied by double-digit percentages in recent days. President Trump is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and tighten the window for new reactor license approvals to 18 months, a process that traditionally is infamous for being extremely lengthy. The markets are holding their gains, including a 2.1% advance in the Nasdaq Composite. Consumer Confidence Soars 10:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer Confidence surged in May, hitting 98 – a significant 12.3-point jump from April. This robust reading defied economists&#8217; predictions of 86, despite ongoing tariff concerns. The markets are widening their lead, including a nearly 2% jump in the Nasdaq Composite. Durable Goods Orders Reverse 9:55 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders fell 6.3% last month, a narrower decline than economists had anticipated but on the heels of four straight monthly increases. The latest data is a gauge on business spending in light of the tariffs. Boeing (NYSE: BA) orders were a drag, falling 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Optimism has seeped back into the markets, with all three of the major stock market averages coming out of the gate higher. President Trump announced a pause on proposed EU tariffs until July 9, fueling a 300-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Technology stocks are leading the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 each higher by over 1%. The proposed EU import tariff continues to hover at 50%, and July isn&#8217;t too far away, but for now, the markets are seeing the glass as half full. The Trump administration&#8217;s deal with the EU suggests further trade partner progress could be revealed sooner than later. Wall Street firm Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock ahead of the AI darling&#8217;s highly anticipated quarterly results due out tomorrow, advising investors to stay long on the stock and weather the uncertainty because the worst is behind them. Other Mag 7 stocks are higher today as well, including Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), each with a 1% jump.

Both stocks have risen by double-digit percentages since President Trump issued an executive order last week. The president is determined to bolster domestic uranium production, send advanced reactors to military and energy sites, and shorten the wait for new reactor license approvals to one and a half years, a process that historically is known for moving at a snail&#8217;s pace. Business Orders Soften 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo Durable goods orders posted a 6.3% decline last month, a softer drop than economists had predicted. However, this dip follows four consecutive months of increases, painting a mixed picture for business spending amid ongoing tariff discussions. A significant drag on the overall figures was Boeing (NYSE: BA), whose orders plunged 51% last month. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Market sentiment has turned decidedly upbeat, with all three major stock market averages seeing gains from the open. President Trump agreed to delay proposed EU tariffs until July 9, which led to a 300-point jump for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also buoying stocks is the latest round of economic data. Consumer Confidence for May came in at a stronger than expected reading of 98, up 12.3 points month-over-month. Economists were calling for a reading of 86 in the face of tariffs.

Over the past month, Palantir is up more than 34%, bringing its year-to-date gain to 62.40% and its one-year gain to nearly 475%. While the stock&#8217;s forward P/E ratio — currently 227.27 — can be concerning, Palantir&#8217;s federal contracts and aerospace ties are expected to continue fueling growth. While earnings are rear-facing, the emerging trends seen in the company&#8217;s Q1 results can serve as a foundation for further rewards for shareholders. In the first quarter, Palantir saw year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. U.S. commercial business surpassed a $1 billion run rate, good for 71% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year. PLTR&#8217;s market multiple implies it could take an investor nearly half a century to recover their initial investment, assuming earnings remained constant. But the assumption from the company — and from Wall Street analysts — is that earnings will continue to grow. EPS in Q1 2024, for example, stood at 8 cents, while EPS in Q1 2025 rose to 13 cents, good for an increase of 62.5%. So while there is concern about its valuation, what can investors expect from Palantir over the next year? 24/7 Wall St. did some analysis, so let’s take a look at. Key Points in This Article: Palantir&#8217;s government line of business accounts for more than half of its revenue, with existing contracts between the AI firm and the U.S. Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Agriculture, the FBI, the CDC, the U.S. Army and the UK&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, to name a handful. The company&#8217;s explosive commercial revenue growth shows that it is capable of sustainably scaling without being overly reliant upon federal contracts. It also provides services to numerous industries, including energy, data protection, health and life sciences, insurance, hospital operations, retail, semiconductors, telecommunications and utilities, among others.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Palantir? The AI environment is ripe for growth, though, of which Palantir should play a major part. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $1.811 trillion by the end of the decade, good for a 35.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2025 and 2030. The global market size of AI in 2024 was $279.2 billion, meaning at that forecasted CAGR, by the end of 2025, the market should expand to $379.4 billion. Companies like Palantir that focus on broad AI applications in diverse industries should see the lion&#8217;s share of that growth. This industry growth potential is one reason Palantir provided strong guidance in its Q1 earnings call, stating that it expects 36% revenue growth, with free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Not only has the company seen sizable growth, it forecasts sustainable momentum that will help continue that pattern over the course of the next year. Palantir’s government segment, which contributes 55% of revenue, grew 45% year-over-year in Q1 2025 to $373 million. High-profile contracts, like the recently signed ICE deal and NATO’s adoption of its AI-enabled military system, highlight its critical role in national security. President Trump&#8217;s emphasis on defense and government efficiency, exemplified by the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, positions Palantir as a go-to AI software provider, boosting investor confidence amid tariff-related market challenges. Additionally, the company&#8217;s commercial segment has skyrocketed, with U.S. commercial revenue up 71% year-over-year to $255 million in Q1 2025. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, empowers enterprises in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing to harness AI for data analytics. Strategic partnerships and 139 deals worth $1 million or more in Q1 (31 were over $10 million) demonstrate Palantir’s private-sector expansion, helping to drive stock gains. Palantir’s focus on operational efficiency has improved profitability, with adjusted operating margins expanding to 36% in Q1 2025 from 29% in 2024. Its software-as-a-service model, with high-margin recurring revenue, supports scalability across government and commercial clients. The company’s ability to deploy AIP rapidly, as shown by a 69% increase in customer count to 593, enhances revenue predictability. This profitability, coupled with $3.9 billion in cash reserves, fuels R&amp;D and market expansion, reinforcing investor optimism. Palantir (PLTR) as a Stock Since its IPO, Palantir has seen uncommon and exponential share appreciation, rising more than 1,300% since going public on Oct. 2, 2020. An enormous part of that growth came between February 2023 and February 2025, before the market began to correct this year. After reaching its all-time-high on Feb. 18, shares of PLTR fell by more than 40% before bottoming on April 4. But for patient, buy-and-hold investors, they have already been rewarded as the stock has pushed back up and established new all-time highs. Following the company&#8217;s Q1 earnings report, Royal Bank of Canada and Deutsche Bank reiterated their &#8220;Underperform&#8221; and &#8220;Sell&#8221; ratings, respectively, on the AI data analytics firm. Most other analysts, though, maintained their &#8220;Hold&#8221; ratings. A notable exception was Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a PLTR perma-bull who reiterated his buy call, saying Plantar is&#8221;one of our top tech names to own&#8221; and setting a $140 per share price target. Broadly, 18 Wall Street analysts assign the stock a consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating, with three analysts giving it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 11 giving it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and four giving it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. However, price targets for the AI darling represent a vast spread of opinions, with the high-end price target at $140, the median price target at $100.13 and the low-end price target at $40. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $150 16.64% Median $1o0.13 -22.13% High $40 -68.89% Palantir Technologies 2025 Outlook Palantir has made several important announcements over the past few weeks, including a $30 million contract with ICE to develop a system to help with deportations, and a partnership with TWG Global and xAI to bring AI to the financial services industry. That news has driven the stock higher in the short term. But as the broad market&#8217;s outlook remains clouded, so too does Palantir&#8217;s. That is reflected in Wall Street&#8217;s consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. The coming year for Palantir&#8217;s stock performance will continue to be shaped by the contracts it wins, both with the government and the private sector. Analysts project a 35% increase in revenue to $3.88 billion this year, though PLTR raised its guidance to $3.89 billion to $3.9 billion, up from its prior forecast of $3.74 billion to $3.75 billion. Palantir calls for a minimum 68% jump in commercial revenue to $1.178 billion, with CEO Alex Karp saying, &#8220;We are delivering the operating system for the modern enterprise in the era of AI.&#8221; While Palantir does face competition from both large AI Big Data forms, as well as smaller, fast-growing AI data analytics shops, the company can be seen as having an entrenched position within government and large enterprises. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Palantir Technologies is less bearish at $107, which represents 12.24% potential downside from the stock&#8217;s current price. Those figures are based on Palantir having developed the premier AI software, but the decreasing cost of AI and expansion of large language models to lower barriers to entrance in decision-making software. We see projected revenue growth rates moderating over time climb from $3.9 billion in 2025 to $11.9 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $0.58 in 2025 to $1.44 in 2030.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values. He said at an event in New York, “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think” they can&#8230;“My own view is people feel pretty good because you haven’t [yet] seen effective tariffs&#8230;The market came down 10%, [it’s] back up 10%; that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.&#8221; Ray Dalio Comments on US Debt 11:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, reportedly raised a flag that Moody&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating misses a crucial point regarding the vulnerability of U.S. Treasuries. According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18. Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX) is a significant gainer, soaring 25.9% following regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) shares are lower by 4.4% on the back of an analyst downgrade. Take-Two Interactive Software (Nasdaq: TTWO) is bucking the trend, climbing 3.7% after a price target increase from Wedbush Securities.

Palantir (PLTR) shares slid Monday, amid a broader market decline in the wake of a U.S. credit downgrade from Moody's Friday. Moody’s said the U.S. faces “persistent, large fiscal deficits” that show no signs of slowing. The downgrade places the U.S. government one notch below Moody’s top Aaa status. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) Palantir shares were down 3% in recent trading Monday. Still, shares of the AI software company have added about two-thirds of their value in 2025 and hit a record high last week on optimism around an improving trade environment. Bank of America analysts last week called the company a “market definer” for companies looking to leverage artificial intelligence. The bank said Palantir’s recent deal with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which came despite pressure on the body to buy from a European firm, “hints at the superior capabilities [the company] can provide customers.” Earlier this month, Palantir reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and raised its full-year outlook.

PLTR,2025-05-13 08:00:04,The Stock Market Crash That Could Ruin Everything,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-stock-market-crash-that-could-ruin-everything-20250513.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"The stock market had a 20% reset in April, which lasted only a few days, if even that. Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now.

Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA).

As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%.

Earlier today, President Trump proved that he was willing to lower tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are expected to come to the negotiating table over the weekend. Stocks are under pressure on the trade deal uncertainty. Aimless Markets 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo Today&#8217;s gains have faded as traders hold out for closure on a trade agreement between the U.S. and China. The three major indices are now trading mixed, including a 0.06% gain in the S&amp;P 500, 0.13% gain in the Nasdaq Composite and 0.13% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Markets are likely to continue trading aimlessly until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. S&amp;P 500 This Week 10:15 am by Gerelyn Terzo Despite today&#8217;s gains, the S&amp;P 500 remains modestly lower for the week, with a 0.06% decline as of Friday morning. There&#8217;s still time for the index to push even higher, especially if the White House announces further tariff agreements with international trade partners. CNBC reported that the broader market index remains mired below a key resistance level, making it difficult for it to break out higher. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Tariffs are having a live by the sword, die by the sword effect, and today that is translating to gains. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from over 100% to 80%, saying that level seems reasonable as Washington, D.C. gears up for negotiations with Beijing. Stocks are rightfully cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning but keeping it modest. The SPX ETF is gaining 0.25% as of morning trading. China could be the first of many tariff deals in the works with U.S. trade partners, according to the White House, further lifting market sentiment. Most sectors of the economy are moving higher, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are participating in the gains, with Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) rising 1% while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is adding 6.8%. TSLA stock is on its way to reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being lifted in part by Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a desirable Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 82.49 (+0.20%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 114.14 (+0.63%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22.51 (+0.40%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but it&#8217;s also one of the leading tech stocks. As of Thursday, Palantir was added to the top-10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, with a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. Comparatively, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers below that level at $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is taking it on the chin today, down fractionally. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is skyrocketing by over 20% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue soared by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%.

Helping, the company’s newest targets for 2025 revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted free cash flow are higher by 4%, 10% and 13%, respectively.

Helping, analysts at Wedbush just raised their price target to $140 from $120, noting that PLTR’s results and raised guidance give the firm “great confidence” in Palantir’s growth story. “We view Palantir as a generational tech name that we see as a trillion-market cap over the next three years, with PLTR being a core name in the AI Revolution theme over the coming years,” added the firm, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.

Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda. As part of his America First vision, President Trump is looking to make the U.S. economy more appealing to investors amid a strategy involving tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; oh my. While the markets await further details on trade talk progress, the three major stock market averages are mixed, including a slight gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Tariff Uncertainty Remains 11:36 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned higher, managing a 7-point gain after starting the session in the red. Meanwhile, technology stocks continue to weigh on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. According to TD Cowen, tariff-related price hikes are set to rear their heads in May&#8217;s inflation print. Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs. Selling Eases 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure this morning but are off their lowest levels of the session. Netflix (Nasdaq; NFLX) shares are off about 2% on the day after last week&#8217;s rally. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is falling 8% on the day after reporting its Q1 results, while industry peer Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 2%.

In addition to earnings, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell set to comment on the economy this week, suggesting it could be yet another roller coaster ride for investors. First-quarter earnings season continues to roll on, with names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) on the docket in the coming days. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red out of the gate, including a 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. Mag Seven stocks are mixed while the sell-off continues to unfold in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) shares, with a 2% decline today. All sectors of the economy are currently lower, the most severe of which is happening in energy stocks, which are down 2% this morning as the oil price continues its descent. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) has reached the end of an era now that billionaire Warren Buffett announced his retirement after six decades at the helm. With $300 million in cash on the sidelines, BRK-B is losing 6% on the day for a market cap of $1.09 trillion. Greg Abel will succeed Buffett at year-end 2025.

PLTR,2025-05-06 12:05:32,Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) Earnings Live: Everything You Need to Know,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/palantir-nasdaq-pltr-earnings-live-everything-you-need-to-20250506.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Post Earnings Coverage 4:06 pm by Joel South To follow along with all the Palantir post-earnings coverage, click here. Palantir stock sentiment before earnings drop 2:19 pm by Joel South Investor sentiment ahead of Palantir’s Q1 report appears cautiously optimistic but notably more tempered than in prior quarters. Capital IQ estimates show that while the mean EPS and revenue expectations remain solid, the spread in price targets — from $18 to $125 — reflects a growing divide over Palantir&#8217;s valuation. The average price target sits at $87.05, indicating that while bullishness persists, skepticism has grown louder. Recent commentary from analysts shows signs of recalibration. While Wedbush reaffirmed its bullish stance, calling Palantir an &#8220;AI pure-play poised to capitalize on enterprise modernization,&#8221; firms like JMP and Barclays have slightly lowered targets, citing valuation headwinds and elevated expectations already priced into the stock. Notably, no major downgrades occurred, but multiple firms noted that Palantir must deliver on margin expansion and commercial revenue conversion to sustain current levels. During the Q4 2024 earnings call, CFO David Glazer reaffirmed a strategy of &#8220;profitable growth,&#8221; which was met positively by long-term holders. The company&#8217;s guidance — specifically its continued expectation of GAAP profitability and strong free cash flow — may insulate sentiment in case of a modest revenue miss. This section will continue tracking updated research notes and model revisions post-call, especially from institutions like Morgan Stanley, ARK Invest, and BofA. Palantir International outlook 2:10 pm Palantir’s global footprint has quietly expanded in parallel with its U.S. commercial surge. Over the past year, international revenue has accounted for an increasingly important share of overall growth, particularly through its strategic focus on European defense alliances, health systems, and infrastructure partnerships. During the Q4 2024 earnings call, COO Shyam Sankar pointed to meaningful traction across NATO-aligned nations, including expansions in the U.K., Germany, and Eastern Europe tied to defense intelligence operations. One of the company’s most prominent wins was a renewal and expansion of its contract with the U.K. National Health Service (NHS), where Palantir’s Foundry platform has been used to manage data across COVID-era and post-pandemic workflows. Additionally, Palantir’s role in logistics, border protection, and humanitarian data coordination has been spotlighted in joint European Commission engagements. International commercial efforts have also been buoyed by AIP pilot programs with major industrial and automotive manufacturers in France and South Korea. Sankar noted that non-U.S. clients increasingly seek vertically integrated AI solutions with real-time operational applications, a shift away from traditional analytics tools. The company emphasized its scalable go-to-market motion in international markets, leveraging pre-built solutions and deployment accelerators. As of Q1, Palantir has field operations and strategic deals in more than 30 countries. Today’s earnings and call commentary could provide additional detail on expansion velocity outside the U.S. and how geopolitical complexity — from Ukraine to APAC supply chains — is shaping the company’s international product strategy. Looking at Palantir&#039;s past quarters 1:57 pm by Joel South Palantir’s Q1 2025 performance will arrive against a backdrop of consistent revenue growth and continued profitability momentum throughout fiscal 2024. Here&#8217;s how the company has performed over the previous four quarters: Quarter Revenue Adjusted EPS GAAP EPS Commercial YoY Growth Gov’t YoY Growth Q4 2024 $608.4M $0.08 $0.04 +32% +11% Q3 2024 $558.2M $0.07 $0.03 +33% +12% Q2 2024 $533.3M $0.05 $0.01 +35% +15% Q1 2024 $525.2M $0.05 $0.04 +26% +20% The Street expects Q1 2025 revenue of $862.13M, a jump that reflects the reclassification of segment reporting following Palantir’s late-2024 accounting update — now bundling U.S. and international commercial performance separately from government. The sharp increase also underscores the momentum of Palantir&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which has reportedly seen deployment across more than 450 enterprises. Margins have steadily improved throughout FY24, with operating income expanding quarter over quarter and free cash flow rising above $700M for the year. Notably, Palantir achieved GAAP profitability in each quarter of 2024 — a milestone that CEO Alex Karp described as a “new era” for the company during the Q4 call. What’s at stake today is whether this trajectory holds — particularly for U.S. commercial, which grew 70% YoY in FY24. Any signs of deceleration in deal volume, seat expansion, or margin degradation could reset expectations, especially given the company’s elevated valuation. Analysts and investors will closely track how Q1 stacks up not just against expectations, but against the arc of 2024’s quarterly performance. A clear inflection or plateau in commercial metrics could dictate how the market responds. Wall Street buzz on Palantir 1:23 pm by Joel South Morgan Stanley: “AI buzz is priced in — execution now must deliver. Margin discipline and real-world conversion metrics will separate hype from delivery.” Wedbush: “We see upside risk to both margins and topline this quarter. AIP continues to gain ground across critical industries.” BofA: “We remain cautiously optimistic. Expect elevated scrutiny on commercial churn, international traction, and government backlog.” Palantir a consensus &quot;hold&quot; 12:50 pm by Joel South Of the 25 analysts currently covering Palantir, the consensus recommendation is a &#8220;hold&#8221;. After soaring just under 400% over the past year, analysts are concerned the stock is a bit expensive. Palantir earnings: What to watch for by business unit 11:29 am by Joel South Palantir’s dual business model — enterprise AI and government solutions — remains its key narrative lever. U.S. commercial revenue now makes up over 30% of total revenue, a rapid shift from prior years when government contracts dominated. In recent quarters, the company’s growth has been particularly driven by adoption of AIP across non-traditional verticals. Healthcare systems, logistics operators, and industrial conglomerates are among the newer cohort of users. Palantir’s Foundry platform is also being embedded into long-term digital transformation initiatives, which bodes well for retention. That said, government revenue still accounts for a substantial portion of the business — roughly 60% — and investors are looking for signs of new contract wins or renewals tied to NATO partners or Department of Defense expansion. Management has signaled a strong pipeline, but details remain thin ahead of the call. This quarter may provide the first clean read on how sustainable AIP monetization really is — and whether the growth is broad-based or driven by one-off pilots. Analysts will want clarity on pricing tiers, seat expansion, and margins tied to newer customer cohorts. Wall Streets expectations for Palantir&#039;s earnings 10:19 am by Joel South Wall Street is forecasting Q1 revenue of $862.13 million, marking nearly 20% growth year-over-year, with adjusted EPS pegged at $0.13. EBITDA is expected to come in at $374.49 million, according to consensus data from Capital IQ. The Street&#8217;s numbers reflect expectations that Palantir’s commercial momentum — particularly in the U.S. — will continue to drive incremental upside. That view is anchored in strong pilot-to-deployment conversion metrics and increased enterprise AIP usage. Notably, the range of revenue estimates is fairly tight ($858M–$862M), implying high conviction in management&#8217;s guidance. The tighter spread also raises the bar for any potential “beat,” making guidance language and commentary on AIP usage critical to sustaining momentum post-release. EPS estimates suggest investors expect Palantir to maintain operating leverage even while scaling up customer deployments. Analysts will likely scrutinize margin trends in both the government and commercial businesses, looking for signals that cost discipline remains intact despite growth. Palantir on a tear heading into earnings 9:48 am by Joel South Palantir enters earnings day trading near 52-week highs, riding a wave of enthusiasm around artificial intelligence adoption in enterprise and defense. The stock is up over 300% year-over-year, one of the best performers among large-cap software names. Fueling the momentum is the perceived commercial success of AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform), which Palantir claims is gaining traction across a growing set of U.S. and international customers. CEO Alex Karp has repeatedly stated that demand for AI is not just hype — it’s an operational transformation. In his shareholder letter, he noted, “We are not chasing the AI opportunity. We created it.” He has emphasized that AIP is now being embedded within the workflows of healthcare, automotive, energy, and manufacturing clients, offering both tactical tools and long-term intelligence infrastructure. Despite strong enthusiasm, the stock&#8217;s valuation remains a key discussion point. Palantir trades at over 15x forward revenue, above peers like Snowflake and Datadog. Bulls point to its margin profile, government backlog, and long-term AI tailwinds. Bears argue that commercial revenue needs to consistently outperform to justify its premium. With GAAP profitability intact and FCF margins improving, today’s numbers will provide further clarity on whether this AI rally is built on fundamentals. Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) will report its Q1 2025 financial results today, after the market closes. Analysts expect revenue of $862.13 million and earnings per share of $0.13, according to Capital IQ. Palantir enters the day as one of the market’s most-watched enterprise AI names. From a company long known for classified government contracts and opaque deployments, it has transformed into a central figure in the commercialization of artificial intelligence — with a fast-growing U.S. commercial business and an enterprise AI platform, AIP, that management calls the most successful product in the company’s history. Founder and CEO Alex Karp has framed 2024 as a turning point for AI monetization, calling Palantir “10 years ahead” of others. In Q4, the company reached 2.2 million subscribers, while reporting GAAP profitability for a sixth consecutive quarter. The business model, long viewed as niche and government-centric, is now being redefined through AIP pilots across 45 Fortune 500 companies. Palantir’s financial story has caught up with its narrative. FY24 revenue reached $2.87 billion, with U.S. commercial growing 70% year-over-year. The company also posted strong operating leverage and free cash flow while keeping headcount flat — a signal of scale without bloat. CFO David Glazer has emphasized margin discipline even amid heavy enterprise demand. Today’s Q1 results will test whether Palantir can sustain that dual-engine momentum — with government revenue holding steady and commercial continuing to scale. AIP usage, commercial conversion rates, and potential commentary on NATO-related partnerships will be focal points. Investors will also be listening for any revisions to full-year guidance or updates on new product lines.

Ford (NYSE: F) stock fell just over 1% on the day ahead of the automaker&#8217;s quarterly results after the closing bell today. When fellow automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported its quarterly results last month, the company withdrew its profit guidance due to tariff uncertainty.

Bessent&#8217;s remarks failed to provide any greater clarity on the status of tariff negotiations with key U.S. trade partners, leaving the markets at a standstill. The three major stock market averages remain mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving higher while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower.

Policymakers are seeking greater clarity before tweaking monetary policy. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan is factoring in zero interest rate cuts in 2025. Magnificent Seven stocks are falling anywhere between 4% and 9.8%, pressuring the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lower. Here&#8217;s a look at the damage as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 860 (-2%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 709.16 (-4.2%) S&amp;P 500: Down 163.62 (-3.0%) Tech Falls, Energy Rises 1:04 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are mired in losses as tech stocks are sent reeling from the tariff fallout. All three of the major stock market averages are lower, including a 1.2% drop in the S&amp;P 500. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is falling a steeper 2%, pressured by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD), both of which are also part of the S&amp;P 500 index. Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq; PLTR) is losing about 6% on the day. Energy stocks are the rare winners of the day, with a 2% sector gain led by Diamondback Energy&#8217;s (Nasdaq; FANG) 3.8% advance. Earnings Growth 11:16 am by Gerelyn Terzo The S&amp;P 500 is now lower by less than 1% on the day, off of its worst levels of the session. Over the past five days, the broader market index has lost 2% of its value as earnings season rolls on. FactSet published a report revealing that the S&amp;P 500 is expected to report Q1 earnings growth of 7.3%, year over year. If that becomes reality this earnings season, it will represent the seventh-consecutive quarter of earnings growth for the index. Historically, most S&amp;P 500 companies print results that exceed estimates, suggesting the index will show growth closer to the 10% area. The markets remain stuck in the doldrums, owing to tariffs, but appear to be coming off their lows of the morning. The S&amp;P 500 is lower by 1.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average are losing 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Retail sales climbed higher by a better-than-expected 1.4% in March, reflecting a resilient consumer. And earnings season is going swimmingly so far. But good news was overshadowed by tariff woes in this headline-driven market after technology leader Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA0) warned of an upcoming $5.5 billion charge on China exports of its processors. Most sectors are seeing red today, including a steep 2.6% drop in tech, while energy stocks are moving higher as a group by 1.8%. J.B. Hunt Transport (Nasdaq: JBHT) is down a steep 8.4% today. Transportation stocks are often considered a gauge of the economy, and signs of an economic slowdown are weighing on the stock. Management has warned that demand could be impacted by the trade wars. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 208.19 (-0.52) Nasdaq Composite: Down 328.13 (-1.9%) S&amp;P 500: Down 62.71 (-1.1%) Market Movers In addition to Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq; AMD) also cautioned that it expects its charge for China exports to reach $800 million, sending shares lower by a whopping 6.3%. We&#8217;ve also got some gainers in the S&amp;P 500. Pharma stock Abbott Labs (NYSE: ABT) is rising 5.2% this morning on a Q1 earnings print that surpassed consensus expectations. ABT is a steady dividend-paying stock with a dividend yield of 1.8%. The company&#8217;s profits and revenues have been growing thanks to robust demand for its nutrition products and its medical devices, both of which are making up for some weaker market segments. Travelers (NYSE: TRV) is gaining 3.6% on the heels of its earnings report. At $257 per share, the insurance stock is within a stone&#8217;s throw of its 53-week high.

Many retail investors have the money but are not sure how to get started in the stock market. With thousands of companies and stocks to choose from, it is natural to get confused. Fortunately, there are exchange-traded funds or ETFs that can help you with the task. These funds invest in individual stocks and help achieve diversification. All you need to do is choose an ETF that works with your risk appetite and investment goals. Growing market volatility has led several investors towards ETFs and the global ETF industry saw an inflow of $1.45 trillion in 2024. If you are ready to invest in ETFs, here are three ETFs to buy in March. Key points in this article: Investors are playing safe and looking for ETFs to park their money. Besides providing immediate diversification, ETFs also generate steady returns. If you are looking for individual stocks instead of an ETF, get your hands on our “The Next Nvidia” stocks, it has one stock with 10X potential. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF If you want a safe way to ride the stock market, consider the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). With a low expense ratio, it is one of the best ways to invest in the top U.S. companies. As of writing, VOO is trading at $546 and is close to the 52-week high of $563. It has generated 15% returns in a year and over 100% returns in five years. It holds 505 stocks and allocates 30% of the funds into the information technology sector, followed by 14% in the financial sector and 11% in the consumer discretionary industry. One good reason to invest in the ETF is that it follows the S&amp;P 500 and you will be able to own a piece of the top companies without having to pick them individually. Some of the fund’s top holdings include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), the four stalwarts leading the tech industry. It has an expense ratio of only 0.03% and the Assets Under Management are $498.5 billion. While it offers diversification to your portfolio, it is heavily dependent on the tech industry for majority gains. Hence, if you are optimistic about the growth of the tech sector, this is an ideal ETF to own. As long as the tech sector continues to post gains, VOO will keep soaring. Invesco QQQ The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is ideal for investors who want higher exposure to the tech sector. It follows the Nasdaq 100 and has an expense ratio of 0.15%. At the time of writing, QQQ is up 14% in the year and 146% in the past five years. Its NAV is $508 and is lower than the 52-week high of $540. Since its launch in 1999, the fund has shown strong performance and generated +443.43% higher returns than the S&amp;P 500. The Assets Under Management (AUM) of the fund is $171.86 billion. QQQ offers high exposure to the Magnificent Seven and allows you to own some of the most popular stocks. Its biggest holdings include Microsoft Corporation, Apple Inc., and NVIDIA, the three tech giants driving the market today. Over 50% of the fund’s holdings are in the tech sector followed by the consumer discretionary. Notably, the fund also owns stocks in different industries and has some long-term winners like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST). The solid diversification of the fund ensures that it stands strong when volatility hits the tech industry. Invesco QQQ is ideal for low-risk investors who seek steady growth and steady income. While it offers exposure to the technology sector, it maintains a strong balance in its total holdings. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF Cathie Wood’s ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NASDAQ: ARKF) focuses on companies that are transforming the financial sector through digital assets, blockchain, and mobile payments. It has an expense ratio of 0.75% and an NAV of $38.07. The fund has generated 31% returns in the year and 54% in the past five years. I believe the fintech industry is going through a solid transition and some of the biggest companies like Coinbase and Shopify will lead the change. There is optimism about the future of fintech and this ETF will help investors make the most of it. The fund allocation includes 39% in the technology sector followed by 28% in the financial services sector and 18% in communication services. The fund’s top three holdings include Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), Coinbase Global Inc (COIN), and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD). These three stocks are on a rally and have impressed the market with stellar financials. However, there is one risk associated with the ETF, if the financial sector falls, the returns will drop. However, the current situation suggests that the fintech sector is poised for growth. The fund has a low NAV, making it a strong buy at the current level. It is down from the 52-week high of $44. If you are someone who follows Cathie Wood’s investment decisions and is optimistic about the financial sector, this ETF is an exciting buy for the month.

After coming out of the gate higher, stocks have since reversed course, with all three of the major stock market indices trading in the red, dragged lower by a 5% slide in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock. There are also some standout gainers. Among them is Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) rising nearly 3% this morning and recapturing the $300 per share level. Wall Street is helping the stock, with Morgan Stanley analysts calling it a “top pick” among auto stocks with a $430 price target attached, reflecting 43% upside potential. Elon Musk’s net worth now hovers at a reported $351 billion. Palantir (Nasdaq: PLTR) is rising over 5% today to nearly $90 per share. Once again, analysts have set the bullish tone, suggesting that Palantir is poised to benefit from government contract momentum despite recent headlines of defense department budget cuts. Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) is extending positive momentum on news of its upcoming standalone AI app to go head-to-head with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini in 2025. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 11.43 (-0.03) Nasdaq Composite: Down 120.47 (-0.62%) S&amp;P 500: Down 19.33 (-0.32%) Key Points Stocks came out of the gate in the green but have since reversed course. Nvidia stock is weighing on the Nasdaq. Tesla and Palantir are bright spots, both recapturing recently lost ground. Other Market Movers MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is another bright spot, rising 4.5% on the Bitcoin rally, owing to the company’s heavy BTC holdings on its balance sheet. The Bitcoin price has been rallying on news of a new crypto reserve being introduced by the Trump administration which will hold BTC, among other digital assets. At $269, MSTR stock is still a far cry from its 52-week high of $543 per share. T-Mobile (Nasdaq; TMUS) is gaining 1.4% on the day on reports of a partnership with AI phenomenon Perplexity. Nvidia is down 5% on the day and is preventing the Nasdaq Composite from further gains. Nvidia is off to a rocky start in 2025, falling 12.5% year-to-date. Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) is falling 4.6%. The Wall Street Journal reported that “AI fever” in the power sector is shifting from nuclear, which Constellation is active, to natural gas.

All on news it just acquired Ambry Genetics and on news, Nancy Pelosi took a stake in the TEM stock by buying 50 of the TEM January 2026 $20 call options. Tempus AI CFO Jim Rogers just sold over 31,000 shares, removing about $2.6 million of value from the stock. However, we wouldn’t read too much into the selling.

Tempus AI CFO Jim Rogers just sold over 31,000 shares, removing about $2.6 million of value from the stock. However, we wouldn’t read too much into the selling. For us, it’s not a significant cause for concern because the funds could be used for personal reasons. We also have to remember that Tempus AI is moving to revolutionize healthcare with artificial intelligence. Plus, the Ambry Genetics acquisition “complements our strategy of leveraging diagnostics and data to drive innovation, further strengthening our ability to deliver cutting-edge solutions to clinicians, patients, and life sciences companies,” says CEO Eric Lefkofsky.

Those gains have faded, but the Dow is attempting to stay alive. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain in the red. All eyes are on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) for hopes of a renewed rally when Wall Street’s AI darling reports its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. In the meantime, there is tech optimism, with each of the Magnificent 7 stocks initially trading in the green but then turning mixed. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has agreed to invest a whopping $500 billion into the U.S. market over four years in an American innovation push, improving sentiment. Apple plans to double its Advanced Manufacturing Fund and is targeting Texas for the development of advanced technology. AAPL stock is up fractionally. Also among the Mag 7 stocks is Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), which has turned south, falling over 2% as of mid-morning. The stock can’t seem to get out of its own way of late and remains close to 30% below its record high of $480 reached in December. In a competitive move, Tesla plans to roll out its driver assistance technology akin to full self-driving software in China. Meanwhile, Rivian Auto (Nasdaq: RIVN) is tumbling 9% on the day. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 42.49 (+0.12%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 174.16 (-0.89%) S&amp;P 500: Down 18.74 (-0.31%) Key Points The markets attempted gains but are struggling to hold onto them. Apple stock is a gainer among the Mag 7 Nike is rallying and helping both the Dow and S&amp;P 500. Palantir Tech is extended its losing streak. Market Movers With Tesla’s sell-off today, Berkshire Hathaway has currently surpassed the EV maker in market cap at $1.074 trillion compared with Tesla’s $1.06 trillion. Berkshire’s stock is up nearly 4% on the day on the heels of Warren Buffett’s letter to shareholders. Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) has announced a wave of layoffs, including 1,100 corporate jobs, to accelerate its restructuring. The stock is up fractionally today. Nike (NYSE: NKE) is bucking the downward trend today, rising 6% and helping both the Dow and S&amp;P 500. A bullish call from Jefferies analysts is the catalyst amid a forecast for “changes afoot.” Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is sinking almost 11% on the day, extending recent declines in a sell-off sparked by reports of U.S. defense budget cuts, where the company plays.

The Dow is spiraling by 500 points and is being pressured by retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT), whose earnings results confirmed tariff-related fears. Among the few technology gainers are Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) as of early trading. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is among the rare gainers in the Dow today. Walmart warned that its profit growth is expected to slow down amid the company’s vulnerability to the likely Mexico and Canada tariffs. Walmart’s stock is down over 6% despite beating consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q4 as Wall Street focuses on an uncertain future. Nevertheless, TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance that Walmart is “hitting on all cylinders” for now, pointing to a resilient consumer that continues to drive revenue. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 502.74 (-1.13) Nasdaq Composite: -165.58 (-0.80%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.26 (-0.72%) Key Points The Dow Jones Industrial Average is spiraling by 500 points. Alibaba shares are soaring after a blowout quarterly earnings report. Big Tech stocks are mixed. Palantir is sinking on fears of U.S. defense budget cuts. Market Movers Alibaba is boosting tech sentiment today, rising 11.7% on the heels of its fiscal Q3 earnings report, which executives attributed “robust” AI momentum . The company’s results were driven by cloud technology as well as AI-product revenue, both of which have been soaring. Alibaba is also receiving tailwind’s from China’s competitive AI investments, including DeepSeek, as a result of which BABA stock has skyrocketed 50% so far in 2025. Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is giving up some of its recent gains, falling below the psychologically sensitive $100 level today amid a 13% drop in the stock. The Trump Administration is defense budget cuts, the industry for which Palantir creates AI-powered software solutions. Toy company Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) is among the winners in today’s session, gaining 11% on the heels of a quarterly earnings and revenue beat. Hasbro has also launched a new line of PLAY-DOH Barbie dolls in a licensing partnership with Mattel that is set to hit the store shelves at Target (NYSE: TGT). Apple shares are posting fractional gains a day after introducing the lower-priced iPhone 16. Citi analysts expect this model will represent 10% of the company’s units sold in 2025.
